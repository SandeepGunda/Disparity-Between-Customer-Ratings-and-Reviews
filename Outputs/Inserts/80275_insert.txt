"Reviews" : "Great place to stay pre-cruise Our family of 7 stayed here the night before our cruise. It was wonderful. The hotel put us all in one large room that overlooked the cruise ship pier. When we got up in the morning we could see our ship! Right across the road was a huge shopping center. When we arrived at the hotel our room wasnt ready they kept our luggage and we went across to the shopping center and had lunch.This hotel was a great location, with awesome customer service."}])

"Reviews" : "Just ok, but decent location Upon arrival the power was out, so the computers and elevators were down. Didn't get to check in until past 4pm, but she did give me free parking, which was normally 20$ a day in their back lot.The hotel is in pretty decent shape. I didn't try the food or the bar because right across the street is Bayside and there are plenty of restaurants and bars there. This is not really a hotel for business as much as it is one for people getting ready for a cruise, as there is a harbor also across the street. Everyone at the hotel was nice and the service was acceptable. Although I would probably pick a different hotel next time, there is nothing significantly wrong with this one. Note that the parking lot behind the building is small and costs money, so if it's crowded you will end up parking on the median on Biscayne, and that's 20$ a day metered."}])

"Reviews" : "Great Pre-Cruise Stay The Holiday Inn Port of Miami was great choice as a pre-cruise hotel. The view I had from my room afforded me the opportunity to observe the cruise ships at the port. I also had a great view of the Bayside Marketplace. The room was very spacious and I had a very comfortable bed. The restroom was very clean and had everything I needed to get ready for my cruise. This hotel is a great value for someone who is either going to the port for a cruise or staying in Miami for a vacation."}])

"Reviews" : "Great views of cruise ship, good breakfast We stayed at the Holiday Inn Port of Miami for one night before taking a cruise on November 13. Check in was a breeze - we got a room on the top floor with a port view. The room itself was more than adequate - comfy bed, lots of room and seating options (a chair and ottoman, a table with 2 chairs and a rolling desk chair). We had dinner across the street at Bayside at Hard Rock Cafe. It was wonderful to be able to cross the street and be somewhere nice. We awoke to the view of our cruise ship docked at the port - adding to the excitement of our trip!We ordered breakfast room service prior to going to bed for the night. We called the restaurant directly - do not use the hang card, there are not many options on there. It was delivered the exact moment we requested it and everything arrived hot and fresh.This hotel met our expectations. No, it's not fancy, but it was great for a short term stay!"}])

"Reviews" : "Good hotel before cruise We stayed at this hotel 2 nights before our cruise. We arrived late (after 11pm) and didn't have any problems checking in. Our room was nice with a view of the bay. I thought the beds were comfortable and I didn't have any problems with noise. The hotel is right across the street from Bayside Market Place so there are plenty of places to eat and you can do some shopping. We ate in the hotel restaurant for breakfast both days, it was a nice meal but I felt it was overpriced. Overall I thought the hotel was nice, clean and in a great location. I would stay here again."}])

"Reviews" : "Couldn't have asked for more! After reading many reviews of this property I wasn't expecting much, but I was pleasantly surprised. We arrived at 9:45 am and asked if we could leave our bags there until check in, they gave us a room right away.. The location and view was amazing, right across the street from the Bayside market place and close to the beaches. I loved everythings about it. Thank you Holiday Inn, we loved Miami and your hotel."}])

"Reviews" : "Disappointed with this hotel We stayed in this hotel for 2 nights in October '08 prior to our cruise. The lobby area was nice and bright but as soon as we got into the elevators we found there was a terrible musky smell.The rooms were dated and tired looking (I suppose much like ourselves when we arrived, having travelled a long distance from Ireland!)Breakfast in the dining room was very nice and the wait staff were friendly.My biggest gripe about this hotel is that on checking out on the Sunday morning we waited at least 15 minutes for an elevator and even then when we eventually all crowded into one, luggage and all, it kept going up and down to the different floors opening the doors to let people on who couldn't because they were full.Looking back it was quite funny because we kept seeing the same people waiting to get on at each floor and they were wondering why we were still there! Now there is a notice on the elevator stating that they do get quite busy at check out times.We couldn't use the stairs even if we wanted to because this only brings you to an emergency exit. The hotel is obviously aware of the problem given the notice they have posted inside the elevator but yet seem to do nothing about it.You cannot bring your luggage down the night before you check out and get them to store it for you as there is a notice up about this also. Therefore everyone is trying to cram into the elevator, luggage and all, on the morning of departure with two elevators at your disposal. I definitely would not recommend this hotel in view of the total chaos on check out morning."}])

"Reviews" : "Port of Miami Great for Pre Cruise This hotel is in an old building but was clean in lobby and room. Pool is undergoing renovation. You can walk to the Bayside Shopping area which has restaurants/bars and a food court. There are also souvenir type places and shops such as Guess. You cannot walk to the the ship terminal as the bay separates the hotel/shopping area from the port. It was a $12.00 cab ride (two people) from hotel to ship terminal. Breakfast buffet at hotel was typical and cost $12.95. There is Macy's etc. 4 blocks from hotel but we did not check it out. There is a McDonalds within walking distance of hotel. Neighborhood around hotel is seedy."}])

"Reviews" : "pleasantly suprised at holiday inn stayed at the Holiday Inn pre-cruise for two days, based on some of the reviews here I was a little worried, I was pleasantly suprised the Holiday Inn was clean and my room was comfortable. The location is ideal, right across the street is bayside marketplace, they have music , numerous stores and restaurantsit's also a short taxi to the port.Only one issue.. they were re-modeling the pool area during my stay so the pool was closed (kids were disappointed) and parking was a pain because the contractor re-modeling the pool was also using the lot for parking which meant less parking spots for guests."}])

"Reviews" : "Okay, but some problems We booked this hotel almost 1 year in advance. We had stayed here 2 years before and had a great experience. This time was a bit different. The hotel is getting a bit run down. We had requested port view rooms and only gave us two rooms with port view. The other two rooms faced the McDonalds in the back! The carpet is getting worn. The tile in the bathtub was stained. I am usually a big fan of this hotel because of location location location! But I probably won't stay again. The restaurant was around $12 per person for breakfast. So we walked to McDonalds around the corner instead. If you consider this hotel, I wouldn't stay more than one night.The positives: directly across the street from Bayside Marketplace and close to Port of Miami. If you have port view, you can see your ship in the morning. Perfect location for cruisers. Easy to get a taxi in the morning.The negatives: The hotel is getting older. Many people paid less for the much nicer Intercontinental a few doors down. The staff wasn't too friendly or accomodating. There is plenty of noise from the street below and the music at Bayside Marketplace. Housekeeping was lacking. One of our rooms had a couch sofa bed, behind the couch was plaster (or something white and crumbly) from the walls all over the floor. It was disgusting."}])

"Reviews" : "Nice bang for your buck We checked in and were wonderfully surprised with the friendly service. Jennifer was very professional, she answered all of our questions. Our room was on the 8th floor facing the port, great view of our cruise ship. When I booked this hotel I requested a room on a higher floor just for the view. The pool area was small but very comfortable. We used the business center, its on the second floor, it was very clean. I also used the laundry area on the third floor, the in room flyer claims that its $1.50 per load. Its not, it was $1.50 to wash and $1.50 to dry, plus a $1.50 for detergent. The beds were very nice and comfortable. The shower and nice pressure. We couldn't have asked for a better location. We also ate breakfast in the dining room. The breakfast was very good. We would definately stay here again!!"}])

"Reviews" : "Not the hotel for you? The hotel is well located close to the shopping and restaurant area which was across the road. The check in was efficient and the small pool area was good to keep cool. The room and bathroom were clean and were of a good standard for the class of hotel.However I cannot recommend this hotel as it has very thin walls and this means that a good night鈥檚 sleep is impossible due to the amount of noise. We were continually awakened by noise from through the walls and also from above and below. If a good nights sleep is important 鈥?well this is not the hotel for you."}])
