The hospitality room which had computers to use for free was excellent, never had to wait more than 5 minutes to get a computer, excellent for researching things for the next day, or booking a trip.In room safe again free.Close to all buses that we needed, they were just down the corner, and only 2 blocks at the most to the beach.Would go back to this accomadation every time, would not return to the other one as nothing was included, everything costed you.

We stayed here because it was our second trip and we wanted to stay on the cheaper side so we could stay somewhere nice for the last few nights. Not bad until I went outside my room to get ice and a man with 2 prostitutes were hiding around the corner from the ice machine. FUNNY BUSINESS. If you want a cheap room with a decent breakfast and pool, this is it. Luxury and ideal other guests, not this place. Then my kids were on the other side of the hall looking at another building and someone from the building across the street was looking at them through binoculars. CREEPY. There is no such thing as views at this place. You can look at the Ala Wei canal or some of the mountains and thats it. It was a 15-20 minute walk to the beach and the only restaurant around was the one at the hotel which we sat at for 15 minutes and left after recieving no service.

We didn't expect too much from the hotel since we paid a very low price for it but it was actually much better than we expected. The staff were very nice and helpful. The complimentary breakfast was very tasty even though it only included doughnuts, (excellent) croissants, toast, coffee, and pineapple juice, butter and jelly. The jacuzzi and pool are quite nice. The pool is only 4ft deep, so it's very nice for children. Another good aspect is that every room has a balcony. And the greatest feature is LOCATION. This hotel is located on Ala Wai Blvd. and Kanepolei Ave. It is only a block away from shops, restaurants, nightclubs, and convenience stores and only about 3 blocks from the beach. For really good and affordable food I recommend Keoni at the corner of Kuhio and Kanepolei Streets for breakfast and the Blue Water Shrimp Co. on Kuhio about 4 blocks west of Kanepolei (please note that this rest. is actually a blue bus. Can't miss it. Don't be fooled by its appearance. The food is actually very good.) One last note, please TIP the maids and the breakfast lady at the hotel, your tour guides, the waiters/waitresses, the guy who brings your chair or umbrellas out to the beach. Please TIP, TIP, TIP. People who work in these industries rely on your tips. So please do not be cheap and TIP. ","SentimentRate" : 0.524, "Sentiment" : "Positive"}])

We booked directly through the hotel website for four nights stay and received a complimentary return hotel transfer and room upgrade to a higher level - our room was spacious, we had two double beds, two balcony's with views over the canal, and was nice and clean. The hotel is very outdated and old, but basically all buildings in Waikiki/Honolulu are old in general, the whole city needs one big refurbishment.

There are plenty of amenities very nearby - including a small grocery store, an ABC store, and several restaurants and bars.The room was clean, albiet a bit dingy. The decor could definitely use an update - but, it was perfectly adequate.

But, it held us over for a bit each morning. We gave the breakfast lady a couple bucks tip each morning, and she didn't seem to mind as much that we were pigging out on the croissants. :)We found the bar downstairs to be quite convenient, with decent food. The fish  chips was pretty good, with a generous portion of fish. They also have a cheap happy hour 2 times a night (4-7PM, and then one later...)

We had two beds, one was a twin, the other called a queen but it was smaller than a double. We managed. Great pool and common area with a helpful concierge and friendly staff. Nice bar, which was often packed. The Japanese lady that runs the coffee shop could cut the attitude. In my travels to Honolulu, this was my favorite location, a mere 5 minute walk to Waikiki but without the late night parties. Great, safe option for families and single travelers.

I planned a girl's getaway for my 7 yr old daughter and myself for 4 days. I knew I wanted to save money on the hotel since we planned on spending most of our money on activities and meals. We have stayed here before with my husband, it was fine. It is run down and not the most lovely room, but i love the bar with good, easy food to be had while my daughter is swimming in the pool. The review said they redid it, but it is exactly the same pool as the year before. The staff is the best, the front desk people are just so nice. I found it a bit harder to take the walk back from the busier streets at night with my child and I alone, so wouldn't stay here again with just the 2 of us, but there really were no incidents at all. Some bad points: never clean towels at the pool, awful stained vanity that sagged in the bathroom, louuuud fan in bathroom, vomit stained carpet right by the bed, plastic wrapped mattresses that give you cold sweats all night, we were right near the ice machine and people partied alllll night long and were LOUD in the hallway.
