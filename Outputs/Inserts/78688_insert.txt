The excellent desk clerk offered to find us another room and made sure that we were happy. In all, the staff were very polite and helpful and it was a very happening fun place to be on a Saturday night!"}])

"Reviews" : "Clean, comfortable and well priced Stayed at the Sportsmen's Lodge for work for 3 nights. The hotel feels somewhat like it has been stuck in 1962, complete with kitschy astroturf ringing the pool. The room that I had was on the 3rd floor and faced the pool. This only presents a problem if you want to get to sleep early as the pool is frequented until about 11pm. Room and furnishings appear to have been updated within the last few years and were quite clean and well kept. Hallways and lobby are beginning to show their age but are quite clean. The hotel restaurant was under renovation during my stay so a temporary dining room had been set up in one of the hotel's conference rooms. The wait staff still appeared to be ironing out the details of this change. As I only had breakfast (cereal and fruit) at the hotel I can't comment on the quality of the food though the selection looked decent for all meals. Staff at reception were quite friendly and happily made taxi reservations to the airport, etc. Overall the hotel is comfortable, clean and offers a decent value for LA area."}])

"Reviews" : "great atmosphere Yes this hotel is in the old style but we loved it. The room was comfortable for 3 of us with plenty of space and it was clean. The service at the front desk was generally very good. We used the free shuttle service to Universal Studios and they also booked us tickets.From the bedroom we had a view of the pool and the hills beyond which I would recommend asking for. The pool was big and warm. At night they put candles around the pool which made it look very attractive. When we were there they were just about to host their annual cowboy gathering ( real ones and film ones!) and so there was some nice singing around the pool by men in stetsons! We also got chating to a guy who claimed he was a TV director- real LA!! Breakfast was served in the restaurant and you could order food around the pool. I have not given this hotel 5 because the restaurant and bar shut at 9pm!"}])

"Reviews" : "Good place We stayed here for the first two nights of a tour  wished we could have stayed longer. Rooms were big, with balconies. Very clean.The hotel staff were very obliging, making me some vegetarian soup after the, very cheap, sandwich  soup supper my husband  I were sharing contained bits of ham floating in the soup. There was a good pool. Best of all, you can buy a 2 day pass to near-by Universal Studios and have free transport on the hotel shuttle bus."}])

"Reviews" : "Great place to stay! I have stayed here two times with my family and we couldn't have been more satisfied with the place. I'll admit that it is outdated, for the most part, although some rooms were renovated a couple of years ago but the rooms remain very clean and spacious. The hotel has two restaurants, one casual and the other white tablecloth, and both offer excellent food at reasonable prices. The Olympic-size pool is wonderful for serious swimmers and frolickers alike, and a cute tiki bar offers every favorite libation. The grounds around the hotel could use some sprucing up, though. Some staff members seemed a little indifferent to the needs of guests but most were nice enough.The neighborhood is safe and walkable with many restaurants and shops located up and down Ventura Blvd., including a Ralph's grocery store just across the street that is open 24 hours. The location, itself, is very convenient to any other area attractions that beckon tourists.I highly recommend staying here if you don't mind a laid-back, unpretentious atmosphere. The rates are reasonable and the parking is free, which normally isn't the case in the LA area. I would definitely stay here again and again."}])

"Reviews" : "Average hotel, great pool The hotel is located in Studio City near by shops and restaurants. The hotel is currently being renovated, which hopefully will improve the rooms, that were ok, but needed a make over. The hotel has a great pool, and there are a cafe (open for breakfast, lunch and dinner - the breakfast was fine), a bar  grill and a restaurant.Parking cost about 10 $ pr. day, internet access cost about 3 $ for 10 or 15 minutes (at the hotels computer).Most nights there were a lot of noise from the bar/parties at the hotel, which was irritating.The staff were friendly and helpful."}])

"Reviews" : "Excellent choice My wife and I booked this Hotel prior to arriving in LA, and were pleased that we did.The hotel is in a reasonable part of Ventura Blvd, with the usual eateries close-by. Its a simple 30 minute drive from LAX, and its close to Universal City for the attractions. Central for the other area's: Beverly hills, Hollywood etc..Room large enough and clean. Pool area was airy and has a bar. You can purchase breakfast at the restaurant near the pool which is excellent value.We had two nights here, and would have stayed longer had we not done all of the LA sights.Overall excellent find."}])

"Reviews" : "Highly recommended. My boyfriend and i stayed here for 5 nights in total. The place had been recommended to us by an LA local, and we weren't disappointed. Our room (a standard king) was huge and well appointed. The staff were very helpful, arranging transport for us around the city, among other things, and were only too willing to help. The valley location was fantastic - close to Studio City, and along Ventura within easy walking distance from the hotel - Jerry's Famous Deli, Iroha sushi, Il Tramezzino (for a great lunch panini), Ole spanish and tapas restaurant. Highly recommended."}])

"Reviews" : "All I expected  My wife  I stayed at the Sportsman Lodge Hotel on Saturday Feb'08th for a one night get away from San Bernardino  loved everything about this place  location. After reading OK reviews I felt I must come back to this site  leave my honest review  opinion of this hotel. We arrived at 6pm  found that at all Excutive Suites were on the ground level  was a bit dissapointed as it wouldnt have the same view as a higher level. As soon as I showed disappoitment of this I was offered two differant Exc Suites with two differant views to chose from, we chose room#611 which had a lovely garden  pool view. After deciding on our room  thanking him for the option we were given 2 free Complimentry breakfest coupons for the Patio Cafe for our inconvinience. Food was great along with appeteziers / thumbs up to the small but friendly bar inside the Hotel  the friendly bar tender. All employess made this great review happen  we will be back for sure ! Must also mention the close proximity to Universal City Walk  also the LOVELY settings this hotel offers such as the white bench in front of pound - thank you thank you thnak you for giving us everything we expected from this one night get away  some . . the automatic late check out was nice too !!!"}])

"Reviews" : "Good value but not great for business travelers I stayed at the Lodge because the rates were good compared to other hotels in the area. The room was clean. The staff was very friendly. The decor is a bit 'tired' and shabby. Overall, though, it was a clean, pleasant stay EXCEPT when it came to getting business done. The wireless service was spotty, especially in the mornings. I wouldn't have minded paying for it if it had worked properly. Will I stay again? Not sure. Great deal for tourists but not necessarily for business folks.One additional note. I saw some of the other reviews where guests complained about the decor, the food, etc. Come on, folks, what are you expecting for prices like this? You want five-star hotel services, book a room at $300/night hotel. This is a decent, relatively inexpensive place to stay."}])

"Reviews" : "Very disappointing I stayed here for a second time, for 6 nights, following a good experience 2 years ago, when I stayed for 10 nights. In a country where hotel and restaurant staff can never seem to do enough for you, the staff at the Sportsmens Lodge were ignorant, unhelpful and generally couldn't care less about my stay or my partners stay. Whilst the pool scene is very pleasant, the rooms are VERY dated and our bathroom had definitely seen better days. I shall never return."}])

"Reviews" : "Overall way too noisy and now they charge for parking We just stayed at the Sportsmen's Lodge for a big event and upon arrival learned that the new owners now charge $10 a day for parking. I find that outragious. They also charge $10 for internet, although some rooms include it for free... now I don't understand that at all.... most hotels include wi-fi in today's world for free. So now it's an extra $20 on top of the room. Can't use the luggage/bell carts anymore (they are locked down and again, we were informed that the new management doesn't allow guests to use them), you have to get the bell man (which obviously needs to be tipped then). And dispite the fact that it's a great location, great pool and surroundings .... the noise was awful. Several events were going on outside and in the bar area and we wouldn't have gotten any relaxation if we wanted to either inside our room and for sure not outside. People walk past the downstairs patio area, because it doesn't have a private barrier - so when we sat in our chairs infront of our patio door, everybody and the world used the path as a shortcut.... very annoying. We wished we had a higher floor just so we'd have the privacy of the balcony. Overall I was very disappointed because for the price we could have stayed three nights at a Best Western ... including breakfast, free internet and parking."}])
