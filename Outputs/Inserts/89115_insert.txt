I got an excellent rate. The hotel was in a very good location, close to the river, Jackson Square, restaurants, etc. Beautiful lobby and great valet service. We could call down to the valet service and they had our car waiting for us when we got to the parking garage. We left an expensive digital camera in the car and one of the valet staff brought it to us because he wanted to make sure that nothing happened to it. Express Check In was down, so we couldn't do that , but it didn't take long anyway. The observation deck was great. We could go up there during the day and see a birds eye view of the French Quarter. We had a Christmas cookie in our room upon arrival. We had 2 rooms and they made sure that our rooms were adjoining. We had a robe in the closet to wear. The mattresses were comfortable. The sheets were soft. They had the room temperature set to 67, which was cold for me, but you can change it. ","SentimentRate" : 0.217, "Sentiment" : "Mixed"}])

Held a company retreat here first week of December and things could not have gone more smoothly. Planning was made very easy by the sales staff. The banquet service was very worth the money. Delicious and varied food choices and excellent staff. The meeting space was exactly what we wanted. Lots of room, lots of natural light, good AV setup possibilities.The sleeping rooms were good. Not great, but not bad at all, maybe the style was a little old-fashioned for my tastes. Would be better suited to a romantic getaway I think. Shower had very hot water and good water pressure. Beds had very nice sheets. Staff was great about getting a coffee stain out, completely and quickly.The only complaint I have is breakfast in the restaurant closed up shop relatively early (before 11 on a Saturday), and their espresso machine was out of order (hardly controllable).LOCATION IS PERFECT. Amazing restaurants nearby (stumbling distance for those of us who like to indulge) and I guess everything in the French Quarter is basically walking distance, but this was perfect because it is 2 blocks away from the noisy streets, so it is quiet, but it is only 2 blocks from the noisy streets, where the fun happens.GREAT STAFF. The front desk and bell staff were very well-informed and helpful and gracious. ","SentimentRate" : 0.264, "Sentiment" : "Positive"}])

Great location! My husband and I were in New Orleans for 6 nights for a medical conference and stayed at the Omni Royal Orleans Hotel. I used to live in New Orleans and I would always pass by it and think what a lovely hotel it was. Indeed it is lovely but they also have wonderful, friendly people working there and good service to go along with it. One of the big positives about this hotel is it's great location. It is close to all things in the French Quarter, as well as Canal Street and catching the Street Car to the Garden District. The rooms are a bit smaller than some modern hotels but they have been nicely renovated. The rooftop bar and pool are fantastic. It is the best view of the river and the Quarter you can get. The bar downstairs in the lobby is more upscale but we really enjoyed this bar as well. Over all, we had a wonderful stay and would stay there again.

It was my first trip to New Orleans and I wanted to stay in the French Quarter. I chose the hotel based on the positive reviews here, the location, and a good deal I got on Hotwire. Upon check-in, I was shown to a very small room with a queen bed, with a view of a wall. I called down to the front desk and spoke to the Select Guest coordinator (my joining this program before I left home was a good idea; I highly recommend it) and politely asked for a complimentary upgrade as my husband and I were celebrating our wedding anniversary. She couldn't have been nicer or more helpful; she came upstairs and showed me two king-bed rooms -- both of which, while not huge, were significantly larger than the queen room -- with a view and allowed me to choose whichever one I preferred. I took room 540, which had a view of St. Louis Street. Room 508, which I was also shown, had a view of Royal Street but was noisier -- I could faintly hear music from the bars downstairs, even with the windows closed. It wasn't very loud, but I am a light sleeper and knew it would bother me at nighttime. Room 540 was near the elevator and was a smoking room, however, I could not smell any type of smoky odor (and trust me, I'm very fussy about bad odors), and its proximity to the elevator was not a problem with regard to noise -- I didn't hear the elevator dinging or anything like that. I did hear people in the hallways during the daytime, of course, but that would be true of any hotel. At night, the hallway was very quiet, and I didn't hear any street noise either.The bedroom was furnished in a pleasant cream and gold color scheme; the decor and furnishings were a bit faded and the bedspread had seen better days, but that didn't really bother me. There was a TV, a locked minibar, a coffee maker, a small but attractive bathroom, and a closet. The bed was comfortable. The overall feeling, in both the rooms and common areas, was that of faded elegance. The hotel could use some redecorating, but it's not rundown or shabby. I've heard it was recently purchased by a new owner who plans to do some updating, and I think that's a good idea. A luxury hotel should have certain amenities (upscale toiletries, flatscreen TVs, good quality bed linens) this property currently does not have. A fridge in the room would have been very welcome, too, as would some type of continental breakfast or evening teatime, etc.What really sets the Omni apart, in my opinion, is its location and level of customer service. The Select Guest coordinator sent complimentary champagne and chocolate covered strawberries to my room as an anniversary gift, and greeted me by name when I passed her in the lobby. The bellmen and front desk clerks were friendly and courteous. Every night the maids turned down the bed and left chocolates and a weather forecast on the pillow. The concierge helped advise me on taking the streetcar. I even had a pedicure in the beauty salon downstairs, which was very convenient. I also ordered room service one day when it was chilly outside; the food, though overpriced, was good and delivered promptly.The hotel's location at Royal and St. Louis can't be beat. It puts you at the heart of the French Quarter, with everything within easy walking distance, and it's not too noisy because it's a block away from Bourbon Street. (A tip: Have the jazz brunch at the Court of Two Sisters restaurant down the block; it's delicious).That said, if you're looking for a quirky, boutique-y French Quarter hotel experience, this isn't the best choice as it is a chain hotel. I stayed at the Dauphine Orleans for one night before transferring to the Omni. The Dauphine is probably more to my taste overall, with its exposed brick walls, balconies, landscaped courtyards, funky charm and free breakfast, but it wanted $180 a night and the Omni's price was better. However, I'm sure I'll stay at the Omni again if I want a great location and a comfortable room at a good price. ","SentimentRate" : 0.000, "Sentiment" : "Mixed"}])

The room was very nicely decorated with a very large restroom. The hotel is located in a great location in the French Quarter, it's close to everything but not right in the middle of all the Bourbon Street partying, which is only a couple blocks away and an easy walk. On the down side, we booked online, directly with the hotel, a Superior Rooms: Offer 150 éˆ?200 square feet of living space and offer one king bed with view of the French Quarter. Got no view of the French Quarter, our view was the roof top and the court yard. Even though thr restroom was large, the rest of the room was extremely small.. not kidding when they say 150 square feet. But the worse of the stay was the lack of cleanliness. The chandelar over the bed was coated with dust as was the light fixture in the bathroom and the dirt coming out of the air vent looked dangerous. Definitely not worth the $300.00 per night.

Stayed with extended family at the Omni for the American Heart conference. American Heart mistakenly reserved two rooms with one king bed each for the five of us. I was willing to accept a king room and add a rollaway, but then the manager offered to upgrade one of the rooms to a suite with a sofabed at no additional charge- very kind! Rooms were quiet and our sleep was not disturbed even thought we were only a few blocks away from Bourbon Street. Each concierge was tremendously helpful and dedicated, with great restaurant connections, shopping suggestions, etc. The on-sight restaurant was a great breakfast option, but had too many other places to go to have an evening meal there, so cannot comment on the dinner menu. View from the rooftop deck is charming, and my husband liked the pool. My father left his wallet behind at an elevator bank, and although it was taken, hotel security was very prompt and thorough, and recovered it within a couple of hours missing only the money. Easy walking distance to great restaurants (esp Brennan's and Arnaud's), Jackson Square and Canal Street shopping. Wi-fi is not free but connections are good. The ONLY downsides were: 1) the in-room coffee is not good and coffee kiosk does not open until 0700, and 2) the hotel has some chipped paint, areas of wrinkly hall carpet, etc.- even though it is very clean, it is NOT modern and glitzy if that's what you are looking for in your hotel. It is stately and regal with character and history, and it feels like it belongs in the French Quarter. We all would go back in a heartbeat.
