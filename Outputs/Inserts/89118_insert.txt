A group of friends and I traveled to New Orleans for an NBA game, just before Christmas '08. I have been to New Orleans several times and now know that even though you can find a hotel with a decent rate and location, you can get killed on parking fees (which aren't always mentioned ahead of time). My previous stay cost $64 for two nights parking, minus any valet tips. Hotel La Provincial had an on-line special the waived the parking fee, had a great rate, and is located in the heart of French Quarter, minutes from Bourbon Street. The check-in went extremely smooth and the room was great. It held the French Quarter charm, nicely appointed, and what can be an issue in even the larger hotels, was clean. It wasn't a huge suite like you may find in the high end hotels, but it was adequate sized and provided everything you would need for a stay in New Orleans. I had a room just off the pool (not that it was swimming weather) and it made for a great sitting area. I would highly recommend this hotel for anyone traveling to New Orleans and wanting to stay in the French Quarters. ","SentimentRate" : 0.368, "Sentiment" : "Positive"}])

The staff could not have been more helpful  friendlier. The rooms are small but this is expected in a French Quarter hotel. We stayed in room 521 which had a terrance sized balcony overlooking Decatur Street which was shared with 3 other rooms. Rarely were the other guests out when we were so it felt more like our own private balcony. The balcony overlooks the park of the French Quarter Market. It was a perfect location for walking to all the sites in the Quarter. We felt very safe when walking in the area. We're already talking about staying there for our next trip to NO.

The location is perfect - only a couple of blocks to Cafe DuMonde and Jackson Square, only a few blocks to the Bourbon Street madness, yet on a quiet street. Our room was the one over the driveway (the one I read complaints about in other reviews here), but we had no trouble with noise. The room was small - typical of a European hotel room or any room in an old hotel in a city center like this. The bathroom wasn't fancy, but it was fine. The bed was a queen size, which is good for us because we normally sleep in a queen, and king size beds always feel too gigantic!The hotel is reportedly haunted, but we didn't see any ghosts. Darn! The only complaint was the continental breakfast, which was very limited. Oh, and the transom window over the door let in light from the hall even when all the lights were out in the room.

The price for this hotel was right, and I left fairly pleased.The rooms were a little small and a bit outdated, but they were clean and functional. The staff was helpful enough, if unexceptional, and there were no major issues during our stay.Location - for many people going to New Orleans, location can make or break the trip. Even though the French Quarter is not geographically large, there is quite a difference in the areas you can visit. I would recommend this hotel for families who want to visit New Orleans and get a clean room for a great price in a fairly quiet location. The area is perfectly safe, and it is fairly removed from the Bourbon St scene. However, if you are looking for a quick walk back to your hotel after a night on Bourbon, you may want to look somewhere else. It is a bit of a hike, but not too far as long as you aren't falling over inebriated.All in all, it was a suitable replacement for my normal New Orleans hotel. Price was great, hotel was clean, and I was happy. Families should definitely check this place out. ","SentimentRate" : 0.493, "Sentiment" : "Positive"}])

The bellhop was awesome and even let my friend park his car there for free when he met me for dinner! They have a nice courtyard and pool and it's a very quiet area. The only downside to my visit was that, after partying the night before and wanting to take an early afternoon nap, all I could hear was the maid's vacuum running and carts being pushed around. I felt very safe in the area, however, some people who live in NOLA told me that you need to be real careful around there, and not to walk alone at night. I left Bourbon St around 12:30 and walked back to the hotel alone and didn't really see anyone...maybe that was a mistake. Thank God for the drinks!

The room itself was lovely, with those pretty plantation shuttered french doors and antique and reproduction furnishings. It was very clean too.Our only complaint was something the hotel could not control. The second floor room was located directly over the driveway entry to the parking lot near the front of the hotel, which in the wee hours was apparently an attractive location for some pretty loud and inconsiderate folks to gather. This did not in any way sour us on the hotel, however. We would not hesitate to stay again but would try to request a room closer to the back or on the courtyard.While the hotel and room were both very lovely, and in a convenient location, it was truly the fantastic staff (including our porter Terry and the morning manager, whose name I unfortunately neglected to get) who made our stay special.

We stayed in room 215, which overlooks the courtyard. The room featured antique furnishings and french doors. The ac worked well, the room was very clean, and there was plenty of closet space. The bathroom was dated, but clean and fully functional. The courtyard has a fountain and is a great place to enjoy morning coffee or an afternoon cocktail, although there is no bar on the premises. The nearby pool was enjoyable as well, but the number of deck chairs is limited. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Coffee and a continental breakfast (muffins, croissants, etc.) are in the lobby for guests each morning. The location of this hotel is very convenient to Jackson Square. I would not hesitate to stay here again, however, there is a downside to staying here. The hotel is made up of several buildings, and I would not have been as pleased if I had been located in the one across the parking lot from the pool area. Also, persons who are looking for a very modern and up to date hotel with all the big hotel conveniences (concierge, coffee in the room, room safes, room service etc.) would probably not be happy staying here. I knew up front what to expect, and I was completely happy staying here. The more modern hotels lack the charm of the Provincial. We were evacuated during our stay due to Hurricane Gustav. I was very impressed with the professional and orderly way this was handled by the city. The Provincial remained open as long as possible to accommodate their guests, while some of the big, modern hotels required their guests to vacate much earlier, and with no notice.

It was clean and well kept, the location was convenient and safe, the air conditioning was great ( a much needed item in New Orleans in the summer), the management hospitable, and the price was right ($62 dollars a night and that was tax included.) Now we used a $50 off deal from New Orleansonline.com, but even without it, the price was reasonable. I'm told that rates are good this time of year. Many travelers don't want to deal with the New Orleans heat and humidity. Downside was the free Continental breakfast (good coffee, but you're better off going down the street for beignets at the Cafe DuMonde.) Also, the maid service could have been a little better if you are the type of person who is a stickler for service. One day they neglected to tidy up our room, provide fresh towels, soap, etc. even though our sign on the door was clearly requesting maid service. We called the front desk and they quickly sent up some fresh towels and washclothes, but even then, they shorted us on washclothes. But maybe the maid was just having a bad day; it DOES happen some time. So this is a very minor complaint. It's a good place. Stay there. ","SentimentRate" : 0.159, "Sentiment" : "Mixed"}])
