WRONG! What was once a hotel bordering on greatness, is now sliding quickly and quietly into ruinous. While checking in for a two night stay with a collegue, the New Orleans Police Department Crisis unit, paid the hotel a visit... we saw no blood, but heard much yelling. Scary stuff. No apologies from the staff - wonder if they are all well acquinted?We had booked two rooms - one was okay, a little scuffed here and there and some odd stains in the bathroom ... the other room's air conditioner was on the blink. Miserable. They offered us another room on a different floor, it was very small and quite dank smelling. Luckily, the air conditioner by some miracle got fixed in the original room. We also had weird unauthorized charges show up after check out. What used to be a charming offbeat hotel with small personal touches, now seems to need a good steam cleaning, higher wattage bulbs and maybe they will regain the clientele they had originally targeted and stave off the SWAT team visits.

It was quite a disappointment. So, please be careful of their 'low' rates because they will really stick it to you on the parking. ","SentimentRate" : -0.245, "Sentiment" : "Negative"}])

The room was very nice, very well appointed, though small. Small bathroom with huge tub and all the usual upscale amenities you expect. Best of all, the staff is very friendly, welcoming and willing to do whatever it takes to make your stay pleasant. As I mentioned, there is generator noise from building remodeling next door. I thought it was just louder than normal room air conditioning, so it didn't bother me, but my son and his fiance in another part of the hotel objected. The hotel moved them to a huge penthouse suite at no extra charge. BTW I picked up a last minute deal on this hotel on hotels.com $69 a night, which was an incredible bargain considering my son reserved on their website and was paying $250 a night. The hotel is a few steps from canal street and about a 5 or 10 minute walk to the French Quarter. To help you locate it on a map, it is just down Camp Street, about half a block from the Sheraton.

We had booked a deluxe king room. Luckily there was a room with two full-size beds available that we were able to move to. We would have preferred a king, of course, since that is what we booked. But had the hotel been fully booked, we would have spent our weekend in what felt like a jail cell with a door above the bed! If you book a room here, you need to call the hotel directly and be sure that you are not the unlucky people stuck in these rooms, which, in my opinion should not be used as guest rooms at all. Apparently there are 5 of them. There is nothing on the International House website or the third party websites that indicate that these rooms exist... plus there is no price difference.On a positive note, the staff was nice, the hotel was well located, and the lobby was beautiful.

When I left the room 30 mins. later, we were told it was $30.00. I spoke to the parking manager, the front desk and the hotel manager and was told the same thing. The hotel manager said they do not park visiting guests and therefore you are treated as if you'd checked into the hotel. This was an outrage and unbelievable. The hotel patron we were visiting was so humiliated, he paid for our parking being that it was a business visit and there were 2 of us in 2 different cars! It doesn't matter if you are staying over night or there for 5 minutes, you will pay the same rate of $30.00. The front desk personnel all the way to the manager were not the least bit accommodating or willing to see the ridiculousness of 30.00 for parking, that is more expensive at the Ritz Carlton, New Orleans premier hotel!Be careful of Parking ","SentimentRate" : -0.248, "Sentiment" : "Negative"}])

It was very convenient to the French quarter, CBD and the Warehouse district. Plus easy access to the Street Car. We booked a room for the weekend before Jazz Fest through the first weekend of Jazz Fest. Very nice bathroom, though the room was small , but very nicely appointed. No view. Quiet, very comfortable bed and lovely linen. This hotel has a most helpful staff. Available, knowledgeable but never intrusive. Great door men. A computer was available in the small comfortable and luxurious lobby. Charming bar that was very much a place to gather away from the hordes of tourist. My 93 year old exceptionally well traveled Mom thought it was a tad dark, but loved it none the less. Our only complaint was that there was no restaurant in the hotel, but I was told that a new one would be opening this fall. Not that we needed more food. Oh my! Great food nearby. We loved the art opening by a fine photographer of some works taken of a few of Nola's great musicians with complimentary wine served in the lobby one afternoon. Nice touch. We will be back again to this special hotel. ","SentimentRate" : 0.599, "Sentiment" : "Positive"}])

Also a fine location, quiet but easy walk to French Quarter or Warehouse district. But it is NOT anywhere near a luxury hotel as per their claim, at least in the standard rooms - our so-called Queen deluxe room was tiny, with a soft and lumpy double bed. I called to ask for another room, and was told that all the beds are the same. The upgrade to King would have cost another $100! (I'm not a large person, just don't like to roll into my husband in the middle of a sagging mattress). breakfast involved granola bars, a few apples and oranges, and terrible coffee. Shower only, no bathtub, no pool on premises, efficient but unenthused staff. Kind of disappointing all in all - it's such a fun city that you can easily get exhausted! -- it would be great to have a better room to relax in.

Stayed for 5 nights for a conference which included the last weekend of Jazz Fest 2008 and was down-right disgusted. Mod hotels (worth $359/night - yes, that's right, was Jazz Fest) should be impeccably clean- it was NOT. Tiles cracked in elevators and foyer, walls need painting, one handle missing on hotel's entry doors (for the whole week?), stains on carpets in the room, no minibar, etc, etc.... The first night I arrived, I got my own luggage out of the trunk of the cab (while the bellman with attitude watched me), then was given a room with no windows and a metal roof escape door in the ceiling. It rained and I got no sleep at all. The second night they moved me to LOFT 523 (sister property) across the street and put me in another dirty room over the bar. Again (although I am coming in at 1-2 AM), got no sleep due to people shouting at each other outside the bar all night! The third night, they moved me back to International House (after Jazz Fester's left) and I finally got some sleep. Friends stayed at Loew's - had great views, superclean rooms, great service, CHEAPER price. Pluses: the manager (although the rest of staff cannot make a decision without him), the bar drinks (although really slow in coming), ran into Tommy Lee at the bar and got a great photo with him. ROCK ON! but stay somewhere else. ","SentimentRate" : 0.141, "Sentiment" : "Mixed"}])
