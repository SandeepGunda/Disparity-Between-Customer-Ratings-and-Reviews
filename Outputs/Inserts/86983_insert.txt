The early check-in was greatly appreciated, too. Great service can really make a difference. Thanks guys!!! ","SentimentRate" : 0.569, "Sentiment" : "Positive"}])

I was born on Oahu and know the Islands quite well. When a great deal came available, which included this hotel, we jumped on it! Positive things first: the hotel is in absolutely the best location in Waikiki. It is right on Kalakaua Avenue and looks directly onto the beach and the ocean, with no obstructions. We walked everywhere ... so easy to get anywhere, from the Moana Hotel (just a block or so away), to the local McDonald's on the corner. The staff is quite hospitable and goes out of their way to accommodate requests. We were especially pleased with Argie and Greg. The negative is that the hotel is really 'tired' ... the furniture in the rooms is old and scratched and dented, even though you can see, that at some point, they were lovely black veneer Chinese. The carpets are stained. The elevator is an E ride in Disneyland! We were originally assigned an oceanview room on the third floor, but after one night (and a request from us) we were moved to the sixth floor. You can tell that this hotel was originally a lovely boutique hotel, but needs some TLC (new carpets, furniture, paint) to get it back to where it might have once been. The rooms are small, but that was to be expected, considering the boutique atmosphere.If you are going to Hawaii and expect a 4* atmosphere, this hotel is not for you. If you have a good sense of humor about things and realize that you got a heck of a deal for a grand location and if you are out of the room most of the day and into the night, then go for it.There was nothing like waking up in the morning to the sounds of the birds in the Banyan tree directly across the street waking up, too. And at night, listening to the business of the street below ... and the feeling of the warm Hawaiian breeze ... well, we liked it ... and would do it again.

This was my second stay here. I had originally read a review about the staff being friendly and decided to stay here. Its the best hotel for your dollar. Its cheap, conveniently located close to everything. Its got the best price for being right across from the beach. The staff were amazing as always. I would stay here based just on that fact alone. The room attendants are very friendly and courteous. Trust worthy! The front desk staff are over the top. They will do anything for you. Greg helped us out both times that I stayed there and he was amazing. I cant wait to go back and visit. I would highly reccomend this hotel to everyone I meet and would definately go back.

Nice hotel for the price, great location but buyer beware on the cheaper rooms. Standard Interior Room means no windows! These rooms do have frosted jalousie windows in the door which opens to the hallway (which is tiny and open to the outside so there is a chance of fresh air while sacrificing security and privacy). Moderate Hotel Room comes with a lanai (balcony). Cool! Except the view is a blank concrete wall of the parking garage behind the hotel. Sound echoes off this wall into your room making it quite noisy with the door open until later at night when traffic dies down and the ac units are shut down next door. This is the room we had for three days. 'Partial Ocean View means no lanai/balcony and room on the side of the hotel near the back. Probably the best of the cheap rooms but it sure is nice to have a lanai in Hawaii. The best rooms are on the front of the hotel and have full ocean views and lanais. If you plan to stay more than a few days pop for one of these rooms and enjoy the sunset with a nice drink. I suggest a can of Pass-o-guava with vodka poured in... shake and drink... better than the candy sweet tropical drinks at any of the big hotel bars. Ingredients readily available at ABC stores which are about every 10 feet in this neighborhood. ","SentimentRate" : 0.210, "Sentiment" : "Mixed"}])

Jeff G. Silver Spring, MD.What can I say? It was what we expected and more. The staff was amazing - from tips on food and hiking spots that only locals know, to being very friendly anytime day or night. Trevor at the front desk was the best and helped us beyond what he should have. If you are looking for a 5-star and book this one - you'll be dissapointed. If you don't mind a few cracks on the floor or a stained carpet (since you don't eat off it) this is your place. Central Waikiki, beachside and lots to do in the area. If you like a friendly place to stay and want to save a few bucks - you're at home. We stayed for 6 nights, had not 1 problem the whole time. Breakfast was continental - pastry, fruit, juice and coffee - enough to satisfy your hunger and get out into the fresh air. For our 1 year anniversary - I have to say thanks to the hotel and staff for allowing us to stay and spend our money on the rest of our trip and not the hotel. Sure, the room was small, but we didn't visit Hawaii to stay in the room. The shower was fun and we could see the beach and our TV from the bed. IF you let the little things in life get to you - don't stay here and take away a good thing with your bad review. If you like to take it easy and don't mind a non-perfect hotel - book it and have a great time where you want to. Just want to say thanks again and we'll book there next time we go back.

The staff at this hotel are amazing, I have never met a group of people that are friendlier then them. The room attendants always say hello when they see you in the elevators and the hallways and try to make a point of remember which room you stay in. The staff always greet you in a friendly manner when you walk past and always have a smile on their face. Although the rooms arent that big, when you are on vacation how much time are you really spending in your hotel room anyway. This hotel has the best rates that we could find especially since it is right across the street from the beach. Greg is one of the front desk staff and he has been there both times I have stayed there and he is always willing to drop everything to help you with whatever you need. Honestly if you are not looking for a room that is huge in size or a top of the line 5 star hotel I could not recommend a better hotel.

I know that this went into the guys pocket, but was desperate to get into the room after travelling from Australia. The upgraded room was smelly, very damp and had single beds, shower full of mould and strings of silicone where leaks had been resealed time after time....Back to the desk new guy on reception wh gave us another room marginally better....The included breakfast was limited and we never did see the promised picnic packs for the breakfast on the beach......I am sure that this hotel was top class in the 1960's but for 2008 it was old, depressing, dirty and the staff were just lining their pockets...wouldnt even class it good enough for back packers......we were supposed to be staying there on the way back to Australia but thank god for my travel agent who changed our hotel booking to a fabulous hotel for the same cost......The minute we stepped into the reception area and saw the dust, and dirty ornate mirror we knew we had made a mistake.

Neither of us had ever been to Hawaii before.. I just have to start by saying that the staff at the Aqua beachside are amazing!!! The front desk guys are all so friendly and helpful, anything we needed they did for us and any where we wanted to go, they helped us get there. At first glance the Aqua beachside is definitly tacky.... the pink carpet, walls and even pink fabricated head boards are a little out of date but they are working on doing renos. We later realized that even though it did seem tacky at first... its actually a really cute and has a ton of character. IT may not be the newest or the nicest place Ive ever stayed but it was super cute. Besides the staff the next best thing about this hotel is definitly the location... literally across the street from the beach! You couldnt ask for a better spot. Our first day we walked out the front door a watched a surf competion right on Waikiki beach. So if your looking for a place tto stay that is friendly, cute, cheap, clean and a great location then this is your place. If your looking for somewhere high end, classy, and romantic.... try the Hilton. I have nothing but good things to say about the Aqua beachside and its staff......Hi Trev and Greg!!

The room was slightly aged but had a charming historic asian design to it. We were staying only one night before our cruise started but we were so thankful to have stayed there.
