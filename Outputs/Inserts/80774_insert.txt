"Reviews" : "Great value! The Stratford is an older hotel that has recently been renovated. So, the rooms are quite small and the elevator is slow. Other than that, though, it's a great deal -- it's very clean, the decor is recent and tasteful in an IKEA kind of way, and the location can't be beat for tourism. I stayed in room 704, which had a great view down Powell St.; though the noise from the street might be pretty bad on the lower floors, it was barely audible on that level. Breakfast was a little stingy, but I'm fine with coffee and granola, so it did what I needed it to do. Seriously, San Francisco has lots of fleabag hotels, but this isn't one of them."}])

"Reviews" : "Cheap and cheerful We booked at the Stratford after a very expensive week spent at the Hotel Nikko nearby. I was there with my parents and we had never been to San Francisco beforePros:- great price- clean room with TV and decent clean bathroom- very central and convenient location - for shopping, transport and travel to and from airport (the Powell Bart station is a few minutes walk away and provides stress free transport to SF International airport)- basic breakfast included does the job to start the dayCons:- Can't really open the window at night if you have a room street-side as there is a lot of noise (the vagrants on Union Square seemed to think that drumming at 2am would somehow convince people to part with their cash)- No safe in the room and only a communal safe at receptionOverall, a very good budget hotel which I would recommend"}])

"Reviews" : "Wouldn't stay here again We stayed here at the end of November for our second visit to San Francisco, the first time having stayed with friends. The location of this hotel might suit some people who want to be in the centre of the city (its on a nosy main street around the corner from Union Square) but we found the noise at night really annoying and it kept us awake. We stayed on the eight floor and our room was tiny! The beds felt smaller than single beds and were not comfortable at all. The room was absolutely freezing and when we phoned the fromt desk to ask how to get the radiator to work we were told that it is on a main timer at the hotel and they could not turn it on for us! The radiator never worked at all for the course of our trip and we were absolutely frozen! The cleanliness of the room was fine and the staff on the front desk were pleasant but I would not stay here again or recommend it to anyone. In my opinion you could get a much nicer hotel for what we paid with Expedia."}])

"Reviews" : "Good hotel for the price We stayed in a Queen on the 8th floor, away from Powell, which had no view but was reasonably quiet when the windows were shut. The room layout was a bit awkward as the sink was not in the bathroom but the bedroom area. The room was clean except for some scuff marks on the wall. The room had a slightly humid feel to itThere is a free continental breakfast, which includes muffins, cereal , toast and coffee/tea.This hotel has excellent access to public transportation around the city and to the airport. Unfortunately the hotel elevator is rather slow.The people at the front desk were always friendly.Excellent value."}])

"Reviews" : "Loud Street Noise, No AC We were looking for a hotel in the Union Square area that we could easily reach by BART as we were flying out from the international terminal the next day. This hotel is very close to a BART station. After having had a bad experience at the Palace (very loud street noise, couldn't sleep), I looked for a Union Square hotel review that did not mention street noise. However, the street noise at the Stratford did turn out to be very loud. There was a band playing across the street until 11PM or so. There was no AC in the room and it does sometimes get hot in SF. So you have to open the window to cool down. The windows only open about 4 inches so it is very tough to cool down. The room was very small, but that is to be expected in SF. It was a remodel of a very old building and the age showed through in some places. There was a flat screen TV to make it look more modern, but it was a tiny one. Because of the low price, I did not feel as bad as I did after staying at the Palace. But I'd only recommend this hotel for night owls for nights when cold weather is predicted, or for college kids planning to stay out late, get drunk then pass out. If I stay in that area again, I'd probably stay at the Hilton two blocks away. I avoided that hotel because it was closer to the Tenderloin but there isn't much difference in two blocks, and there are panhandlers between the BART station and this hotel anyway."}])

"Reviews" : "Excellent Location Two night stay at Stratford exceded our expectations. The location is absolutely perfect. We took the BART from the airport and hotel was less than five minute walk. We arrived early and were greeted by a very friendly and accomodating staff. Our bags were stowed until check in time and we headed out. Bus and MUNI are also only a few minute walk away and the trolley runs directly in front of the hotel. Had lunch and returned to hotel. Rooms are very small but comfortable and clean. Similar to accomodations throughout Europe. Walls however are a bit thin and can hear walking over head. We are not light sleepers so this was no problem for us. Would definitely stay at this hotel again. Cannot beat the price and location for downtown San Francisco."}])

"Reviews" : "Great location, good hotel Booked this hotel purely on the reviews I read on here and wasn't disappointed. There seemed to be A LOT of bad hotel reviews for San Fran.Reception desk staff very polite and keen to help. Lift very slow, but we were on the 7th floor so persevered with it!Had a twin bed room which was quite spacious although not much room for 2 large suitcases.We we at the front of the hotel so was quite noisy, if i stayed again, which i would, i'd request a room at the back. Slept well despite this.Bathroom spacious and clean. Had a big window which let in lots of light, shower over bath was right next to the large frosted window, bit strange, but on a high floor so wasn't too worried.Breakfast included which was convenient , nothing amazing, but definitely enough to keep you going until lunch.Location - don't think you could get more central. On Powell St in the heart of everything - shops, restaurants, trams etc... Noisy, but its a city. Would certainly recommend."}])

"Reviews" : "All I needed The other reviews have it right. The rooms are small and most have only one bed. Make sure you book a family suite if traveling with more than one other CLOSE friend. Most rooms have only a shower, no bathtub, which is fine with me, because I only take showers. My room was immaculate, and stayed that way throughout my stay. Furnishings are simple but the bed was comfortable and everything was in good condition. Only had one trouble - there was a circuit breaker for the bathroom and light over the sink that tended to trip. The front desk clerk told me how to reset it.Desk staff was friendly and helpful and checking in and out was fast and easy. There is an included continental breakfast in a nice tea room on the second floor, but it is minimal. There is bread and toasters, granola and yogurt. There is a nice selection of muffins. They have coffee, tea, milk and two types of fruit juice. I wish they had had fresh fruit. The room filled up fast when they opened at 7:30, but there was more seating by the time I left at a little after 8. If you want an American style breakfast, several restaurants in the area have it.Location was great, two blocks from the Powell St. transit stations, which meant that I got there from SFO on BART in less than 45 minutes for only $5.35. It is steps from Union Square, and less than four blocks from the Moscone Convention Center."}])

"Reviews" : "location, location, location! We stayed here for 3 nights and picked this hotel purely on location and that most reviews stated it was clean. We were not disappointed on either. The hotel is just up the street a few minutes walk from the start of the cable car route to Fishermans Wharf and Union Square is about half a minute walk around the corner. We got BART from the airport ($5.35pp) and walked up Powell Street to the hotel. The young man at reception was most helpful and showed us on maps where the hotel was and pointed out areas to visit. He also said that if we wanted to know anything to come back and ask.The room we had was small as we expected but very clean with a reasonably comfortable bed, a sink in the room and a separate small room with shower and toilet. There was a hairdryer beside the sink and an iron/ironing board in the small wardrobe. Towels were replaced daily. After hiking around all day we didn't notice any noise at night!Continental breakfast was included in the room rate which is unusual for US. This was orange or cranberry juice, yogurt, cereal, toast, muffins and hot drinks and was adequate to keep us going until lunchtime.There were plenty of places to eat around the hotel - we had great Thai food just around the corner in Muang Thai and enjoyed Lori's Diner too. We also had dinner in Jazz Bistro Les Joulins which was lovely and very reasonable with the added extra of live music.The shopping around this area was great too - every type of shop from Gucci and Louis Vuitton to Ross and Marshalls!We would stay here again due to cleanliness, value for money and location, but don't go if you want 5 star luxury and plan to spend lots of time in your room."}])

"Reviews" : "cute place...great location! we stayed at the stratford on august 31 for one night...the room was very small, but well laid out. the bed was comfy and the linens we nice and clean. overall, the room was spotless. the bathroom was actually a decent size considering how small the room was. the only thing about the shower was that the drain was a little slow..so the shower kinda filled up with water. we almost overflowed onto the floor oopps! the hotel offers a complimentary breakfast in a great tea room that has lots of windows. you can look out and see the hustle and bustle of the street and the cable cars zip by. the breakfast was simple...toast, cereal, muffins...hey! it's free!i would totally stay here again!"}])

"Reviews" : "Great for tourists... I stayed here for 4 nights during the labour day weekend (Aug - Sep 08). Firstly, the location!!! Perfect for any tourist wanting to be close to all the action and be able to get around town easily. We were able to catch the BART (subway) straight from SFO to Powell station and walk easily with our suitcases to the hotel. In addition, the cable car turnaround on literally 100m away - so it was easily to get to all those tourist attractions (i.e. Fishermans Wharf, Lombard st etc)Although we were initially surprised by the tiny room...we soon made ourselves comfortable. As mentioned by other reviewes..there isnt much floor space for your suitcases however the bedroom and beds were clean - which is important when you just want a place to sleep in at the end of an exhausting day.The complimentary breakfast was a plus. Definitely saved times in the morning wondering around deciding where to eat (and whether anything had opened yet). Although it was quite simple...it was enough to get your day started with toast, muffins, coffee and juice.The only hotel improvements I would recommend are:1) Improve the lift service (it was excruciatingly slow)2) Install air conditioners in the rooms (although our room was quite cool and we never thought twice about needing it)3) Have the sink inside the bathroom as opposed to next to the bed4) Consider having a clearer shower curtain so that you can have some light whilst showering (there were no windows in our bathroom and the only light was in the center of the room)All in all...happy with our stay!"}])

"Reviews" : "I was taken by the stratford hotel! Have you ever bin cheated or have money stolen from you? Well that鈥檚 what happened to me at this hotel!They told me that for ALL three nights it would cost me $159.00 I made sure to tell me it another time, so that it was made clear. But when I got the bill it was 159.00 for each night! When I talked to them about it, they laught at me! When I told them I wanted to talk to the mangier, they wouldn鈥檛 let me!Don鈥檛 let this happen to you! But if that doesn鈥檛 sound like a bad price to you, here is the rest. The rooms were nice, but very small. The free breakfast is only muffins, and toast. Also orange juice and coffee. I would have staid there again if the price was decent. It is an ok location."}])
