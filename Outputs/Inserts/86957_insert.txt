I cannot imagine staying here on vacation, but then again, I'm not into Waikiki Resortland so I wouldn't want to stay anywhere in the vicinity. Big plus is its location - it's fairly easy access to H1 and just around the corner from Ala Moana/Nimitz. For those who need to be near a mall, Ala Moana mall is right next door and is accessible through a second floor bridge. It's easy to get to Ala Moana park, too.The room is clean and contemporary, but teeny tiny. The bed linens are sanitized according to a little sign under the glass top of the bedside table - yeah, I wasn't too worried in a place like this (or am I just being naive?). The bathroom is also quite small but clean. I did have to request a change of the shower curtain liner, as the first one just reeked of mildew and I couldn't take it any more. Oh, and the rooms aren't Wifi, which I *hate.* The lobby is apparently wired for it, but I just don't see the point.The pool area is pleasant, although traffic noise is inescapable. Liked the workout room. There's a club (???) in the lobby that I did not even begin to think to check out. Ditto the restaurants. All of the staff were perfectly friendly and responsive.I'd stay here again for business, but never for vacation. ","SentimentRate" : 0.058, "Sentiment" : "mixed"}])

The staff is friendly and the location is pretty great. It's also a lot better than many of the shady non-resort places in Waikiki.Good: It's a great value, and is attached (sort of) to an enormous shopping and dining complex. There's trolley service to Waikiki for $2 each way, which beats the pants off trying to find parking. Ala Moana Beach Park is right across the street.Our room was pretty well equipped, and came with a refrigerator and microwave. Parking is $15 a night (as of September 2008) in the hotel garage - lower than most places in town.Bad: The parking garage that connects the hotel to the shopping mall can be kind of shady at night. My wife and I were approach by vagrants several times.The walk to Waikiki is a little bit longer than it looks on a map - it was about a 30 minute walk for two reasonably in-shape people. But, if you aren't absolutely set on staying in Waikiki it's not that big a deal and (as above) there is a trolley service.Pool is tiny with not much shade. The rooms (at least in the Kona tower) are also a little on the small side. They're fine for two people but any more than that would probably begin to get uncomfortable.No room in the hotel has a really stunning view (the main tower faces the road), so get whatever's cheapest.

Never again Bad Beds!!!/ Pretty hotel with nice elevators that worked, the view was great from the 16th floor. BUTthe rooms were small and the beds were harder than in the stone age! I have stayed in rooms in 3rd world countries for $50 a night that had much nicer and newer mattresses. These must have been from the 70's!the Mgt. was called and housekeeping brought another mattress pad. wow!!I had to take off the bedspread double it and put it under the pad. still not much better, all for $175. a night I will not stay here again. Aqua Equus down the street has much nicer rooms with new pillowtop mattresses and flatscreen TVS, for under $100 a night if you need to be by the Marina.

Ala Moana caught my eye because it offered WiFi, had some in-room facilities such as microwave and fridge, and was very close to the convention center.The facility was clean and quiet, but with limited amenities in terms of regular restaurant hours, bar hours and so on. This inconsistency is difficult for a person who is working and comes back to the room tired and wanting something more substantial than a microwaved meal.The Ala Moana shopping mall is right next door, which does offer a lot of restaurants and the like, but it's still a walk, and the hours are limited as well. The neighborhood behind Ala Moana is a mix of storefront restaurants, adult entertainment venues, and just not all that savory, particularly for families or women on their own.The location is what will upset most people that visit Ala Moana, particularly if they're expecting to be on the beach. There's a lovely pool, and I had a great lanai with an impressive view. The WiFi worked fine, and most of the staff was very friendly and as helpful as they could be despite the limited amenities.

My husband was in Honolulu for work and was advised to stay here by a coworker. I joined him at the end of his stay here (three nights). The room was very nice and the lanai was wonderful. Location was excellent - close to shopping and dining. The tour desk was always willing to help when looking for places to eat and how to get to destinations (Dole Plantation). The pool area is beautiful and we were lucky enough to have a room that faced the ocean - a definite bonus once you look past the Macy's parking lot. Free internet was good (reasonably high speed - about 100K/s at night) and parking was convenient (prepaid was $12/day parkade - up to $32/day if you just pay as you visit). When husband arrived, he had two double room and requested a change to king, which they accomodated. He thought it was a larger, nicer room for the same price! Overall, would recommend. We debated changing hotels (as we'd already booked at another location for our vacation time) since we liked this one so much. ","SentimentRate" : 0.647, "Sentiment" : "Positive"}])
