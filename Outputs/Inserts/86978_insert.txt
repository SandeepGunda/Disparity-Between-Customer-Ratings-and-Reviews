We were not disturbed by any noise, found the beds comfortable, and the bathrooms clean. The breakfast on the beach was so much fun, and I loved trying the different options they had, like soba noodles and kimchi. We would usually be so full we wouldn't need lunch. There was occasionally a wait for our car to be brought up, but the valets were friendly and helpful. Skip the in-hotel store and walk down to an ABC store for a wider variety of items. Waikiki Beach is literally across the street, and the restaurants attached to the building were tasty too. The hotel is closer to the Diamond Head end of the beach, but we didn't think it was too far from all the action at all. ","SentimentRate" : 0.489, "Sentiment" : "Positive"}])

I love the location and the rooms are more then adequate for the time you stay in them. The beds are extremely comfortable and especially since I am pregnant. Having the fridge in the room is very convenient to have access to cold drinks after a hot day on the beach.The breakfasts are great - very convenient - those who complain can go elsewhere for breakfast if they don't enjoy! The rest of us love them. Esp with the music and Hawaiian dancer for entertainment.My only complaint of the place is the amount of plastic that is used for breakfast that is not recycled. There should be a recycle bin for the containers - it would save this beautiful island and ocean in the long run! RQ should look into more environmentally friendly containers and/or recycle the containers.The elevators are great - what's a the two seconds it takes to have your key ready for the safety it provides!Love the location, view, Tiki bar - will go back in a heartbeat!

The hotel was a great property! traveled with 3 teens and had a 2 beach front rooms. Definitely ask for a higher floor to see over the palm trees. The pool water was much cooler than the ocean because the shadow of the building towers over it all day. The breakfast on the beach was fun for a few days but the breakfast buffet wasn't all that great. The rooms were decorated in a cute Hawaiian fashion sense with red and white hawaiian print and bamboo on the walls. Bathrooms were somewhat small but service was great and rooms were clean and safe which was good enough for me!Tiki's the hotels restaurant is higher priced for what you get but very good.

Omlettes, melen, yoghurt, croissants etc etc etc. and then go over to the beach and have your breakie. Its a nice hotel and I recommend the side view of the sea room! Have fun!

Overall, we really liked it. It is indeed right on the beach and also on a convenient bus line for getting around. They provide a breakfast which was convenient but not so tasty, really. The one thing they have really going for them is an EXCELLENT, friendly staff. Over and over again they were great. Not good: we were on a very high floor on a windy day and the howl of the wind through our room was disconcerting. Also, as everyone else has said, the elevators are goofy. One example, I get on on the first floor, wanting to go to the 23rd, it goes up to 6, stops, the doors don't open, it returns to the 1st floor, doors open, more people get on, it goes up to 11, doors don't open, drops people off on a couple of more floors and finally goes to 23. Its like they are haunted. But people are just being stupid if they can't handle sticking their keycard in the slot. The complaining about that on the other reviews is really overblown. I'd stay here again. ","SentimentRate" : -0.092, "Sentiment" : "Negative"}])

Our Oceanfront rooms were much more than we expected, particularly given some of the reviews that I had read by some travellers. We had never been to Hawaii before and so not knowing what to expect, we found the hotel service excellent from the valet parking through to the front desk and have nothing but compliments for the housekeeping staff. Even when a blackout occured and the lifts couldn't be used, the staff were very helpful in ensuring we got in and out of the hotel.Much has been made of the lifts and the use of the card system to get access. It is true that it can be a bit tempermental but really we were on holidays so a minute here or there didn't really affect us too much.Breakfast on the beach was a novel idea. Given that it is complementary it wasn't too bad. The food is basic by Aussie standards but there was plenty of it. It is a shame that it closes by 8.30am as having teenagers we were rarely able to make use of it. We had both doubles and King rooms all of which overlooked the beach. The rooms themselves were lovely and a genuine 3 star standard. The bathrooms are cozy but they were clean and well maintained. The beds were the equal of anything I have slept on in a 5 star hotel.Overall the members of my family ranging from elderly down to mid teens all agreed our stay at this hotel was very enjoyable and we will definitely look for Resortquest around the world when next we holiday. Thanks to all. ","SentimentRate" : 0.259, "Sentiment" : "Positive"}])

My boyfriend and I stayed November 27-Dec. 2 for a long weekend getaway. We were very happy with the location (right across the street from Waikiki beach) and all the things we could walk to. In a short walk you can cover all of Waikiki, catch a free hula dance at Duke Kanahamoku's statue, shop Kalakaua Avenue, relax in Kapiolani Park, and even go off the main streets for a bowl of Japanese noodles or a locals bar. Our only complaint during our whole stay had more to do with Hawaiian state law - specifically that you can NOT smoke inside any building on the islands except private homes, and more frustratingly, in five days of trying we couldn't find a single business where you could have a drink and a smoke at the same time. You have to be 20 feet away from the property line, I guess, so you can't even sit on a patio and smoke while you have your drink. It is SO frustrating when you are on vacation, trying to relax! The best we could find was Duke's Canoe Club in one of the big hotels on Kalakaua, where you can stand on the beach with your drink literally on the property line and as long as you don't get caught too many times, alternately smoke and drink. We felt like naughty teenagers! ","SentimentRate" : 0.025, "Sentiment" : "Mixed"}])

In fact, each evening I looked forward to returning to the soft bedding, the super white sheets, and the mellow contemporary furnishings. Even the staff seemed genuinely friendly and helpful.Again, we had a baby, so I decided that the A/C, with limited controls, was perhaps too drafty. I turned it off and the room temperature was just fine through the night.If you are traveling with a child, the location couldn't be better with Wolfgang Puck and other take out eateries downstairs, the zoo next door, the beach across the street, and nice specialty boutiques at the Marriott also next door.There was always wind noise from the hallway and we could hear the revelry below even though we were on the second highest floor. Baby slept through it and so did we.We had trouble with multiple card keys but perhaps it was just our particular door lock. The cards were easily replaced (more than once).Before arriving, I was quite concerned about the age of the building. Having stayed there with nothing but surprisingly fond memories of general contentedness, I can say that the age of the building shows but all the creature comforts which matter (carpeting, tv, beds, bath tubs) have been updated and well cared for. The cleaning staff even moved the baby's travel crib to vacuum beneath it!If the price stays competitive and the reviews remain solid, this hotel will be our first choice on future visits to Oahu.

We had POOP on the covering on our bed. We didn't notice it for 2 days because we just used the top sheet to cover up with at night.. The comforter with the covering had it on it. At first I thought it could be chocolate but I found out it wasn't. I went to the lobby and they changed us to a different room. The did a slight upgrade. The housekeeping was very poor - even in the new room. I am a very tidy housekeeper at home and I realize this is a hotel but this could have been much better.The information desks didn't know anything about where Pearl Harbor, Diamond Head, and other sites were located. We rented a car and took off on our own. The very front where the limousine for the wedding picked us up was who helped us out tremendously! The tall blond guy - I don't know his name - was very helpful in everything!We loved the location of the hotel - easy access as far as walking to restaurants, stores, etc.The breakfast in the morning with the entertainment was great!

I thought the check in and out was easy and fast. We were appointed a ocean front room on the 17th floor. The room itself was a little worn down, tiles in the bathroom were in need of repair and cleaning, the carpet was worn down. I am afraid of heights so I asked if I could change rooms to a lower floor and they were very accomadating and gave us one on the eighth floor. The view was awesome and the room was in better shape. The location is perfect, walking distance to everything. Shops and restaurants close. Beach right across the street. One complaint is that when you asked any of the staff where things were located or if they knew what times events were, they were clueless, they would just look at me, mumble something and appear that they were busy doing something else.

My wife and I stayed at this hotel Nov. 2, 2008 to Nov. 13, 2008 inclusive. I must say this hotel is clean, in a good location and close to beach. The bonus is having your personal cooler and buffet breakfast which you can either take to the beach or back to your room. The sitting area near the pool fills up quickly with little room left -- not enough seating. Breakfast is from 6:30 to 8:30 but you had better get there before 08:00 as the supply and selection disappears very quickly.The elevators can become a nuisance as you have to use your room key to access the elevator. I guess it provides that extra level of security but that's questionable as anyone can enter the elevator and push the floor number once any room card is used.Pool: is located on the wrong side of the building and you do not get any sun near the pool until 1:00 p.m.Pool area: closes at approximately 7:30 p.m. which leaves no place for patrons to sit, relax and enjoy the music from the club next door. There is no other place to sit and relax with the pool area closed but to go to other hotels who do let patrons sit by the pool and relax even with their pool closed. This to me is a drawback and a real disappointment. Several elderly people who were just sitting and relaxing were even asked to leave the area because the pool is closed. Where else can a person go to relax but to other hotels. While in Waikiki you do not want to be confined to your room but relaxing in the outdoor air. I have addressed this problem with the hotel itself but they do not seem to have any interest in changing their policy. Pity.Tiki's restaurant and bar located near the pool area can become a bit loud during the night with the music from the bar. After a few days you get accustomed to it and tend to live with it. Overall, on a scale of 1 - 10 I would give this hotel a 4.5. I would not stay there again but at nearby hotels that do let their paying customers sit and relax later that 7:30 or 8:00 p.m. ","SentimentRate" : 0.011, "Sentiment" : "Mixed"}])
