The price was right, so I jumped on The Equus, also thinking that, Hm, the rooms look really nice. First of all, the location sucked. If you want to be close to the main beaches are so that you can go surfing early in the morning by foot, this hotel is not for you. If you look at the map of Waikiki, this hotel is located at the very edge of Waikiki. If you don't mind being at the edge, try to be on the other side(near the zoo). There is more action. Rooms were OK, but expect no view. No bathtub in my room, just a tiny shower that I can barely wash myself down properly. Oh, I had to borrow hair dryer from the front desk. Continental breakfast consisted of dinner rolls(I think it was poi bread? it's pretty good bread, actually) , fruits, juice and coffee. It was enough to get me started in the morning, but don't expect a filling breakfast. Staff were very nice and helpful. So, overall, would I go back? Probably not , now that I know the area. What if it was offered really cheap and my stay wasn't long? Then I may stay there. ","SentimentRate" : 0.442, "Sentiment" : "Positive"}])

Searched around for a decent, budget hotel, thought the Equus sounded interesting, and booked on Orbitz.This is NOT a Boutique Hotel. They claims all types of extra amenities and services that simply do not exist. Yes, the rooms and furnishings have been updated, but it should be compared to a Ramada or Comfort Inn. At the prices charged, you should be able to do MUCH BETTER, or save a few bucks and stay at a budget motel.Examples: There is NO WIFI. The front desk clerk will send you to the pool area, in an attempt to find an open connection (from a neighbor). If unsuccessful, they will send you down the street to Starbucks. All of their promotional materials and even check-in documents claim extras like 24 hour coffee and teas in the lobby - no longer available.The pool is also a joke - situated in a narrow opening between two buildings, so there is no sun - or even furniture to lay down. Hope you don't mind stairs - there is no elevator service from the lobby to the street level / parking - a lawsuit in the waiting (handicap access) - good thing Carlos is there to help with luggage. The only rest room on the main floor is in their hospitality room - where the sink is used to prepare breakfast; I went to wash my hands after using the rest room, and there were coffee pot components there.BTW: The pictures shown on the Orbitz web site are of a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PROPERTY.Upon returning home, we filed a complaint with Orbitz, who did not seem to care. After waiting 2 weeks, we were given a $25 code for use wuthin the next 12 months.Despite what others have claimed, there is a VERY nice beach in walking distance - Ala Moana Regional Park, just across from the mall. The beach is clean, maintained and not crowded, and the swimming area is well protected. ","SentimentRate" : 0.186, "Sentiment" : "Mixed"}])

Of the three, the Waikiki Wave was the best, but this hotel definitely had its merits. It's located on the northernmost end of Waikiki beach, across the street from the Hilton Hawaiian Village. Even our 3-year-old had no trouble walking along Ala Moana Blvd. to cut through the Hilton Hawaiian Village to get to Waikiki Beach. Ala Moana Beach Park is also within walking distance.Two of the main reasons we chose this hotel were for in-room internet access and parking. For a $65 deposit, the hotel provides a router for reliable high speed internet access at no charge. As for parking, it's true that you have to park in the parking structure of the hotel behind the Equus (the Aqua Marina), but it has a remote controlled security gate and unlimited in and out privileges. (You don't have to wait for your car or tip a valet every time you leave the hotel.)The free continental breakfast isn't worth staying for. Instead, venture down Ala Moana Blvd. to the Wailana Coffee House for a really great breakfast. (It's a favorite among locals and tourists.)When entering the hotel, you do have to walk up one flight of stairs before reaching the elevator, which some may find very inconvenient.The rooms are small, but comfortable and clean. The air conditioning works great and is virtually silent! We did not have a balcony, but some rooms do. Our room had a shower, but no bathtub. In addition to the bathroom sink, there was a bar with a sink, a coffee maker and a small refrigerator. One word of warning -- the two double beds in our room were quite small, but that's typical of hotel beds in Hawaii.If you MapQuest directions from the airport to The Equus before you arrive, you'll have no trouble finding the hotel. We would certainly stay here again. ","SentimentRate" : 0.394, "Sentiment" : "Positive"}])

The prices are decent if you're on a budget or don't plan on spending much time in the hotel. My one major compalint is the sound proofing. We were on the 4th floor and the outdoor noise seemed to be amplified in the room. Tons of loud motorcyles kept going by for hours making me constantly turn the t.v. volume up. We could hear everything the people staying in the room next door said no matter what time of day. So sound lack of sound proofing was an issue. Oh, and it would have been nice if they had a bath tub or at least a larger shower.Other than that, the decor was up to date, and their basic double bed room has a small fridge/freezer combo which came in handy. The free breakfast starts at 7:30am and is pretty picked over by 8am. It's basically fresh fruit, fruit salad, and assorted muffins and rolls. The staff is friendly, and the location is great if you want to go to the Ala Moana Mall or Hilton Hawaiian Village. It's also close to a McDonald, Subway, and plenty of other places to dine.

There are 2 beaches nearby (10-15min walk), Dukes opposite the Hilton and the lovely Ala Moana beach park on the other side of the Marina. All the staff were very friendly, especially Rene, and if you're there on a Tuesday there's a nice touch of a drinks reception where management and guests mingle.

Some staff members sound like they are forcing themselves to be hospitable. Your complaints will mostly fall on deaf ears. But if you are looking for a place to deposit your bags while you explore Hawaii, this is a good place to be in. I especially liked the (free!) newspaper, fresh juices, mini muffins and pastries, and fruits served in the lobby every morning. Just do not be late! The staff removes everything promptly at 9:30am. It is almost comical. They really look like they are scrambling to get the food out. (ha ha ha) This hotel also runs out of shampoos and soap bars. The free internet in my room was very nice when it was working. There were several times during my 7-day stay when I get really frustrated with it. But I liked it. Basic and saves you a lot of money.
