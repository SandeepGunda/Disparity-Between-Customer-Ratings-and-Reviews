Hallway looks creepy at night with portrait photos looking at you in a mean way....scary. Can't complain...a good hotel to stay at but may recommend to look for another hotel in SF."}])

"Reviews" : "So So Location is pretty good, close to Powell and market St. We asked for a Queen Bedroom, but instead got a twin double, but we're not too fussy. The bathroom was tiny and old, but clean. TV reception was fuzzy, but it didn't mattered much on our trip as we spent our time sight seeing. Room was stuffy, and the ceiling fan didn't do much in terms of cooling the place.The walls were paper thin. We spent a friday night there, and obviously a bunch of kids booked a room next door and used it as a base to their night out. Woke me up at 3am just with their conversations.All in all, it was pretty much what we were expecting for the price."}])

"Reviews" : "Convenient hotel, but small room Stayed for 2 nights while visiting San Francisco during a tour of South California. Because we had a car it was convenient to use the public car park opposite for which we paid a special price because we stayed at the King George. The hotel was seconds, literally, from Union Square which was handy when we carried all my wife's shopping back to the hotel.On the first morning we went to Alcatraz and the hotel organised a cab which was there on time, although the worst journey I have ever taken. We didn't see the bridge from a distance due to the mist, but went on the bus to the end and walked over. One thing to watch out for, after visiting Alcatraz we walked along the main road at the front and made the mistake of entering a shop to buy a video cassette. The guy in the shop spent 25 mins with the camera that I had made the mistake of letting him hold showing us the benefits of a lense that ended up costing a fortune. Didn't buy it, but couldnt get back the 25 mins either. Be wary."}])

"Reviews" : "Comfortable Stay I always have a hard time sleeping in hotel beds because of discomfort. This hotel was the exception. The beds were comfortable, the rooms were clean and pleasant. The rooms are a little small, but there is so much to do within walking distance that you wouldn't want to stay indoors too long. I would stay here again without a doubt."}])

"Reviews" : "Quaint, clean, great customer service, great location! I was hesitant to book a stay at the King George due to some of the previous reviewers' comments regarding the small rooms and the thin walls... However, the hotel was much better than I expected, and I would stay there again!It is true that the rooms are very small - however, the space is used very efficiently, and I never felt cramped. In fact, the closet and safe were much more spacious than those provided in larger hotels.It is also true that the walls are very thin - but this was a minor inconvenience, and a non-issue with good ear plugs :)The hotel was suprisingly clean, the bed was very comfortable, and the shower was great (good water pressure, plenty of hot water, etc.). There are two fitness centers within a couple of blocks, and the hotel can provide special pricing for a day pass. They offer a continental breakfast for a fee, but there are also several diners in the area (one right next door) that serve breakfast. There are also several convenience stores nearby.The customer service was wonderful - top notch. The staff was very friendly, attentive, and helpful. This alone would bring me back to the King George.The location was fantastic - very close to Union Square, shopping, and the cable car line - and easy walking distance to Chinatown and other downtown attractions.There are dozens of other hotels in the area, and the more expensive choices are probably more luxurious with better amenities - but the price, cleanliness, and warmth of the King George make it a worthy choice."}])

"Reviews" : "Things stolen from room We stayed 3 nights in the hotel. Great location and nice clean (small) rooms. Good bed and friendly staff.Whilst packing our bags on the last day we found out that all our luggage was searched during our stay. It was done very conscious and careful that's why we discovered it that late.Result: Laptop stolen (with 2 weeks of holiday pictures; it didn't fit in the safe) and several chargers. Strange thing; they toke the charger of my wife her lady-shave, but left the lady-shave it self in the room.We suspect the housekeeping, but can't proof anything.Unfortunately it took the hotel about 1 month to respond and as far as we are aware, they didn't do anything with our suspicion. The only access to the room was via a key card."}])

"Reviews" : "King George - A Prince of Hotels I was a bit leary due to some of the mixed reviews for the King George. My stay could not have been pleasanter. I arrived early and my room was ready and waiting. The room was small but clean, recently redecorated and the bed was great. The bathroom was a bit shabby but the towels were fluffy, and there was tons of hot water and good pressure (I was on the top floor).The area is noisy but it is right downtown. The theatre district and Union Sqare are right there. Plus it is a five minute walk from the BART station so I saved tons of money coming in from the airport.I did the continental breakfast most mornings. I found it provided okay variety for the price. There was a choice of breads, cereals, yogurts, boiled eggs, fruit, orange juice, coffee, jams and cream cheese. My only complaint was that the fruit was a bit boring - just apples and bananas. But I could eat what I wanted and they were healthy choices. I had eggs, hash browns, toast, coffee and and OJ one morning at a local deli and my bill was $13.65. The staff was pleasant and helpful from check in to when I left. The restaurant staff is friendly and there is a concierge who was a good resource.Overall, I highly recommend it"}])

"Reviews" : "We will be back! My husband and I spent 2 nights at the King George while vacationing in San Francisco and the area. We wanted to stay in the Union Square area without paying too much. We were very happy with the King George and plan on returning! The hotel had lots of charm and the location was perfect! A very short walk to union square, lots of restaurants, and a couple blocks from cable cars and public transportation to get you anywhere you want to go in the city.The staff was very friendly and helpful. They went out of their way more than once to make our stay more enjoyable. Although I have read many reviews about the hotel being too tiny and noisy, we didn't have this problem at all. Yes, the rooms are small, but it is an old hotel and it's not like you are going to spend too much time in your room anyway. We thought the hotel was very quiet as well. I would highly recommend it!"}])

"Reviews" : "Nice, comfortable room, no frills. Nice, comfortable room, I booked it the day before and after fees and charges it was almost $200 but the location and general amenities made it almost worth that. It can be had for in the $130 range and that would be about right. When I stay in the City (which is frequently) I'm really only there to lay my head after a day of fun, and the King George is fine for this purpose. The room was small but more than enough room for a single...bathroom was clean and everything worked, and a small closet held an iron, hangers and a coffee maker. Well worth the price for the prime location."}])

"Reviews" : "Nice Place, but noisy This is a nice hotel, if the decor is a little dated, but the dated nature of the place is the real problem. Our room faced the back and it was very noisy when we opened the window to let cool air in. Nighttime was the real problem as we could not sleep with the window open as there was some mechanical unit thumping outside, and when we closed the window and had the fan running, it too thumped loudly. Not only that, the design of the place has the next door bathroom right next to our head while we were sleeping, and because the walls are not insulated for noise we heard the neighbours, and those above us, everytime they flushed the toilet. The old style doors also let in an inordinate amout of light and are not made for keeping out noise from the hallway. As for size it was a nice size and the bed was reasonably comfortable and the coffee and tea service is a nice touch. The staff are friendly and helpful, but ask the concierge for directions not the front desk people. It is a clean place, and a good place to rest, if not get a great night's sleep."}])

"Reviews" : "Smallest room yet in Union Square I wonder if hotels give you their less desirable rooms if you book through hotels.com (Expedia)?The hotel was quite basic. Although I'd reserved only 1 room through hotels.com, at check-in, they had reservations for 3 rooms for me. Since hotels.com had charged me for only one room, I didn't worry about it. The reception staff were courteous.The location is ok, close to BART, MUNI and a fairly easy drive to the highways.The room was not so great - very small. Also, it had the smallest bathroom I've been in yet in Union Square hotels. But the biggest inconvenience was that there were no easily accessible power outlets. I had to move the bed to access one for my laptop. But I did appreciate the wireless internet, included in the rate, even though it was slow (no watching streaming movies). The bed was quite comfortable. Room service is from Lori's Diner right next door."}])

"Reviews" : "King George Hotel, San Fran Stayed for four nights. Room a bit small and could do with upgrade but otherwise fine. Great location, only 2 mins walking distance to Union Sq and around corner from great pub, Foley's. Breakfast in hotel was expensive compared to nearby restaurants where you could get big brekfast for $10. Hotel were charging $7 + tax for continental . Free coffee available in the morning in Hotel.Location of hotel very handy for rental car depot on O'Farrell St - just across the road. Nice area but a lot of people hanging around begging and really 'in your face' stuff."}])

"Reviews" : "Great location, very pleasant staff This hotel has a fantastic location just one block from Union Square. It is slightly old fashioned in terms of decoration etc, but it is very clean and well maintained. The rooms are average size, not large, but not small either. There is no air con, but we had a window that opened, providing fresh air and also an overhead fan.Our room was non-smoking, as requested and the bed was comfortable. The bathroom was very clean and actually not a bad size by any means. Shower worked well and there were sufficient amenities including fresh towels on a daily basis. The decor of the hotel is slightly reminiscent of a 70's hotel but nevertheless, served a purpose. There is no room service and the hotel bar serves only wine and beer. Happy hour is between 1700-1900, I believe. The staff here is excellent. So friendly, helpful and pleasant. The concierge went the extra mile for us and so did the front desk staff. They also offer a chaffeur service to SFO airport at a slightly cheaper rate.I would stay here again. Any questions, please do not hesitate to drop me a message.PS- The diner next door is fantastic, great staff and great food. Please visit , you won't be disappointed.PPS- I've rated this a 3 star based purely on amenities as per standard, not on quality. Quality would score the hotel 4, easily!Thanks"}])
