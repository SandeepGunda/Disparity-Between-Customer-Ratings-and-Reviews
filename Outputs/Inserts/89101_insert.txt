It is in a good location close to everything but very quiet. The lobby is cool looking,very modern.The rooms and beds are comfortable,I had a corner room and had an awesome view of the river.All hotels are older so you have to take that into account in the French Quarter but unless you are very picky it is fineI want to mention Sue in valet parking. There are not many people in the hospitality industry that can remain untainted by how the public acts. She is the most friendly lovely person I have ever met in this business. During our last trip a girl lost her cell phone ,Sue searched ,called cab companies and continued to look even calling the mother to let her know she had not found it. That is so far above the call of duty. She greeted us as old friends and was just as lovely and helpful this trip. ","SentimentRate" : 0.300, "Sentiment" : "Positive"}])

I stayed at this hotel during 4th of July weekend this year. My girlfriends and I went there to enoy the Essence Festival. I must say overall I was impressed with the hotel and the staff. This hotel was booked to capacity and yet all the staff members were courteous and the service was good. I can't say the service was excellent because there were so many people the hotel had to cater to at one time. My biggest complant was A) the parking which took 1 hr and B) the elevator system. Upon arrival of the thousands of people, it would have been nice to have a HOTEL attendant assist but hey.. I understand why they did not. My friends and I stayed in one room(4 ppl) and we had a great view of the city and the river. This was centrally located to all the hot spots in town and I felt very very safe. I'm sure this facility is even better at 50-75% capacity. ","SentimentRate" : 0.540, "Sentiment" : "Positive"}])

The location of the hotel is great. It is easy to get to since it is located on Canal St. and it is located just on the edge of the French Quarter. While the hotel is nice, the rooms are very small for the rate that they charge. I wasn't too impressed with the quality of the rooms either. We found little black hairs on some of the wash cloths and the hotel shampoo was left over from the previous guest. The parking was absolutely horrible. To start with, they charge you $30 to park your car at the hotel and valet is the only option. When we parked, we were told to call down 15 minutes ahead of time to get the car. Well, when we were checking out, they told us that we had to go down to the lobby and wait in line for 30 minutes to give them out parking stub so that they could retrieve our car, which took another 20 minutes. It was a 50 minute ordeal to get our car. The parking area was completely crazy with close to 100 people trying to get their cars. There are just too many other hotels in New Orleans with better rates, better comparable rooms, and trememdously better parking accomodations for me to ever stay here again. I expected much better from a Marriott hotel. ","SentimentRate" : -0.112, "Sentiment" : "Negative"}])

Encounters with every staff person were warm and friendly. The bell staff guided us to our restaurant picks and gave us further reccomendations.

We dislike valet parking due to the inconvenience (little access to car, wait time, etc.), not the price. There is no option except valet parking here.- Internet. Excessive fee ($15) and they don't even have wireless access.- Elevators. They claim to be more efficient (touch your floor number outside, then you are assigned an elevator that goes to that floor, no buttons on the inside). But they aren't. As an example: On 3 occasions, we entered our floor number, assuming we'd be assigned to the elevator that was sitting right there at the lobby level, open and ready to go. Instead, we were assigned the elevator that was at the highest floor, which we had to wait for (you can see where the elevators are located when you enter your floor number).- Food options. Over priced and limited selection at breakfast, but the restaurant seemed to be a decent place for dinner.We don't understand why the big hotels will nickel and dime you for parking and internet.PROS:- Comfortable room, although a little small (but that's expected from a downtown hotel in a big city).- Excellent location and friendly staff.Would return to this hotel, but not for the price that we paid.

Hotel location is perfect. Close enough to the action to walk but far enough away from the craziness. Very close to ACME oyster house (a favorite) and the Harrah's casino. Cab fare for 4 was 50$ we thought that was really high. Hotel provided great service...let us check in very early, gave us two rooms on high floors with excellent views of the city. Rooms were small but clean and well equipt. Had some temperature control issues with showers. Liked the elevators and found them to be much quicker than the traditional ones. Lobby is huge with really comfortable seats. Good drink and snack selection. Starbucks in the hotel charges $.60 for refills! ","SentimentRate" : 0.275, "Sentiment" : "Positive"}])
