"Reviews" : "Beautiful Renovated Hotel This is a favorite long time hotel of my family. We just stayed again for Christmas Eve and loved the new renovations. Staff was excellent as usual. This in my opinion is the best hotel on Nob Hill. Beautiful and elegant, but not over crowded with tourists the way the Fairmont and Mark Hopkins are.Now my critic; They moved the restaurant from the far corner of the hotel into the lobby area to be more centeralized and accessible to the guests. The result is a beautiful restaurant, but left us all wondering where is the lobby. There is no lobby sitting area, unless you go into the restaurant. This felt very weird. Come on put a couple of couches out near the front desk.Second the old restaurant space is now empty. It had overlooked the cable car intersection. This would make an excellent and very interesting bar area. I suspect they will just use it as meeting/function space. Too bad.Overall a great hotel and will stay again in the future."}])

"Reviews" : "Five Stars My husband and I stayed at the Stanford Court for one nite as we were in the city to go to the ballet. We were pleasantly surprised that it had been renovated and is so beautiful,modern, fresh and clean. Our room had amazing views of the bay and the city and was very modern. The lobby looks great and we enjoyed some appetizers and drinks at the bar. All the staff were friendly and accommodating. I highly recommend this hotel and we will be back!!"}])

"Reviews" : "Stunning hotel I booked this hotel for work since I mostly stay at Marriott properties when traveling. Marriott's are usually consistent and nice business hotels. I stayed for Thanksgiving weekend before work at the Hilton on 333 OFarrell street. It was a little outdated and there were a lot of panhandlers outside the hotel even though it was right near Market Street with the flagship Bloomingdale's and Barney's. I was disappointed in my selection.For all that was at fault with the Hilton, just a short distance away was paradise. This hotel was at the top of Nob Hill. It was devoid of the problems I previously experienced. I stayed on the 5th floor which could have had street level noise but it was no problem. It was classic San Francisco with incredible views of the bay.The $32 million renovation was just completed. It is magnificent and a wonderful combination of vintage charm with modern comfort. The only negative is the pricing on parking. $45/night is steep but it is San Fran. I have a feeling this hotel will raise its room rates soon once the word is out. I highly recommend staying here."}])

"Reviews" : "Awesome! Stayed here on Dec 4. I did not stay here before the renovation. The money was well invested. The staff is 5 star. Not one complaint. Excellent service from the valet to the check-in to housekeeping. The hotel feels like a RItz. Everything is nice. I had a corner room on the 7th floor with a bay view. Unbelieveable. Awesome views of the city and the bay. The room was huge! The TV was great, too. The fitness center is top notch! Location can not be beat in Nob Hill. Cable cars are right out the door. I booked on the Marriott site and got a mid-week rate for $159. It included to cabel car passes and a free breakfast. You can't beat this deal in downtown San Fran! It is unheard of! I'm sure I won't get this deal next time I book, but it was a great deal on this last trip.I usually stay at the Hilton downtown or the Courtyard at Oyster Point. The Stanford Court is my new #1 hotel in San Fran!!"}])

"Reviews" : "Would Not Return Again My wife and I recently stayed overnight for a conference. Had dinner, breakfast and stayed one night in what I presume is a typical single queen bed room. On the upside the service (especially at dinner) is very attentive. The food was above average - nothing to come back for though. The place has been recently remodeled and very clean overall. On the downside, the rooms don't offer much sound insulation - you can hear a lot from neighbors running water and flushing to people talking in the hallway just outside the room. The rooms are relatively small given this place is older so the beds are close to the doors. We had a room that faced the interior (and ugly) courtyard which is supposedly quieter but not by much. Keep in mind the outer facing rooms can be noisy with clanging cable cars til 1am. What made it worse is that a bunch of drunk women were rudely talking loudly in the hallway and next door at 2am waking both of us and making us lose about 1.5-2 hours of sleep that night. We called security which arrived in about 5-10 minutes to shut them up. However, the night front desk man called me 1/2 hour after the security arrived just to see if these drunkards shut up just when I was trying to fall back asleep. I mean, why call me, man? If there is a problem I will call back. How stupid! He must have been a rookie. Lastly, the wait to get my car back from valet parking was longer than reasonable - not enough personnel. I would definitely shop around for a better place since there are many fine hotels to choose from in SF."}])

"Reviews" : "Renovation produces a gem Stayed a delightful weekend in mid November. The ambiance is as if you had just arrived at a friend's house. Easy arrival and check-in. Concierge was well informed.Located at the corner where all the cable cars pass thus Union Square, Market  Powell and fisherman's wharf are all accessible without effort.Top of the Mark is just up the street.Newly decorated rooms and public spaces are scrumptious to the eye.As the renovations are still underway (rooms 90 percent converted), there are still some startup glitches. My room did not have the promised safe and mini bar, which was brought promptly when I asked. The TV remote did not work and was replaced promptly. The new TV channel lineups were not yet published to the in-room directory."}])

"Reviews" : "Loved Stanford Court My husband and I stayed in this hotel for 3 nights while we were visiting San Francisco. We had a great stay in this hotel. Only complains are the water pressure was slow from the sink faucet and the valet fees are a little high. Our room was on the 5th floor facing to Powell and we saw the cable car . It also has a nice view. We heard some street noise on the first night since it was Sat. Sun was a little quiet or may be we got used to the noise, it did not bother us much. Starbucks coffee is a nice touch in the morning especially my husband is a coffee person. We missed the champagne since we were always out during that time. The hotel room had no fridge. But we requested one. The front desk staff was very nice and also greeted us. We borrowed an umbrella from the concierge since it was raining on one of the nights. The valet parking service was very good and staff was very friendly as well. The court yard of the hotel is big (not on the street) so we did not feel rush when we dropped off the car for valet service. We walked to Union Square. Going there was easy. Coming back was hard since we had to walk up to the hill. But we enjoyed the walk. We also walked to Chinatown and Tadich Grill for dinner. Be prepared to involve a lot of climbings if you are not using car/cable car."}])

"Reviews" : "Nice place! This is a very nice refurbished hotel. I had a request for a king, they were out when we checked in, so they gave us a queen with a great view of the bay. It was very nice and clean. I thought the size of the room was fine. Something I noticed is that the front desk area always smelled good, kind of like a spa. I thought that was a nice touch. They have free Starbucks coffee in the morning and champagne at about 5 by the front desk. The ice machines are not in yet so just call and they will deliver it, and anything else you need right away. It is at the top of a very steep hill so just be sure to get a cable car pass so you can jump on if you are not always up for the walk. The staff was very nice and always greeted us weather we were leaving or returning. Concierge was very informative and helpful."}])

"Reviews" : "First Class I got an excellent rate via Expedia. Never heard of this Hotel before. I was satisfied alone with the price... but when I arrived at the Hotel, I was immediately impressed with every aspect that this establishment had to offer. We arrived at 11 am and check-in is 3 pm. However, the front desk advised me that they had a room available and at no extra charge I was in my room at 11 am. They serve complimentary starbucks coffee and morning champaigne in the lobby. The ammenities are remarkable and so many details that I can not explain here. I forgot my shaving cream and razor; the front desk had them delivered to me within 5 minutes. The staff is absolutely friendly and the whole place had a friendly and welcoming!The location is right off Powell street so the trolley is literally right outside the hotel. Very convenient to Fishermans Wharf, sNobb Hill, and The Mall. I highly recommend this hotel to everyone!!! MU"}])

"Reviews" : "Come Here and Enjoy- The Renovations are over! I used priceline and paid $115- so inexpensive. The check in rep. offered me a view on the 3rd floor (highest priceline option) which may have cable car noise, or an interior room. I chose the view and the windows were so well insulated that the noise was no problem (and I am a very light sleeper). The view was great because the hotel is on top of a hill.The room was huge and gorgeous. The staff was professional and friendly. The location was excellent and all the public areas were we appointed. They had evening free champaign (unlimited). The parking was an insult (over $50 w/tax), but the Masonic Events Center two short blocks away had it for $30 (a fair price in this city).I would definately recommend this hotel."}])

"Reviews" : "I really felt like home !!! Me and my wife stayed in the Stanford Court 4 days, then I went to Wine Country and Carmel and returned for more 3 days. And both of my stays were very pleasant.The renovation was almost done, and did not bothered we at all.....and in the end of our stay we could see part of the new lobby already.The rooms were fully renovated very good with all the ammenities you'll find in a 4 star hotel.If you want a silent room ask for a courtyard view room. You will lost the partial bay area view, but won't get annoyed by the cable cars bell (they run until 12 PM)The staff is absolutely friendly from the front desk to the house keeping staff, everybody was naturally warm.Other special point was the attention we had from the master concierge, Mr. Ric Lee, who help us with the reservations in some of the best restaurants, and they also helped me with flowers for my wife's birthday.The only con I can say was the US$45/day parking, except for that everything else was great."}])

"Reviews" : "Overrated Stanford Court We recently stayed at the Stanford Court on Nob Hill in San Francisco. It has just undergone a major renovation. Unfortunately the rooms are extremely small and the closet is in the bathroom. We were unable to get breakfast at the hotel and our TV didn't work most of one day -all we got was excuses. This hotel does not now live up to its old reputation for excellence. There are many good hotels in San Francisco and this is not one of them. The Stanford Court has 4 star prices and 2 star service."}])
