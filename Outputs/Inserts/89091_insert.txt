The LePavillon Hotel was exactly what we needed. If you have seen the movie Gone w/the Wind then the lobby will be a replica. Of course this is just my opinion. The lobby and the dining room was exquisite. Now I must confess that the room (King size) how ever breathtaking it was, is a little small but still very beautiful. The decor of the bathroom was chic. But you won't be in the room that much because there is so much to do. We were there for five days. Most of the time we rode the street car which is a 1.25 one way. I would also recommend that if you are going to be out pretty late take the taxi from LePavillion to the casino or to the French Quarter. It will run you around $8 or $9 dollars one way. I probably gained 10lbs because food is everywhere. The hotel offers a buffet for $18 have Pat make you an omelet!!!!. Often we would return to the hotel late and would still be hungry. The food from room service was great. It will probably run you around $50 and up. Also, please, please take the Katina tour. What you see in the tourist area is not what you will see during this tour. If while you are on the tour and they don't mention about the bridge that goes to Ward 9, please inquire. Overall we are looking to revisit the LePavillon in April. Oh, I must also tell you don't remove anything from the Refreshment Center unless you are going to pay for it. The refreshment center has a sensor and records everything you remove. I found out the hard way, but they removed it from my bill. I truly enjoyed myself and I can't wait until April (my birthday).

I'll start off by saying that I got a great deal on Orbitz that included the breakfast buffet which is valued at $18pp. The food and service was great. And Miss Pat makes amazing omelets!The lobby is nice, holiday decor, etc. Because I booked through Orbitz (at a low rate), I think that we managed to get the worst room in the hotel. Top floor, right next to the entrance to the pool/roof which means we heard a lot of door opening and closing. Also, we had 2 doubles instead of 1 king. The hotel would've charged us extra for a king at check-in b/c we booked thru Orbitz.I was not impressed with the room. Way too much stuff to collect dust IMO. Fake plants, bed ruffles, lace shower curtain with fabric covering, table cloths. Also, the beds weren't comfortable.I can't help but wonder if some of the other rooms might be nicer. The location is great, close enough and far enough from the French Quarter. We had a great rate, and that's what makes my review above average.

Super opulent surroundings with quite small rooms. You wouldn't want to try and get more than 2 in a standard, but that's to be expected from an old boutique.This place is a little less casual than I usually choose, but it certainly is nice. Plus for the roof top pool and hot tub and the complimentary PBJs from 10:00-11:00 each night in the lobby (although people of my ilk will not be around any hotel at that time). This hotel would be an ideal romantic getaway more than anything else. Great, great deals on Hotwire as well. ","SentimentRate" : 0.562, "Sentiment" : "Positive"}])

The hotel tries too hard to have a renaissance sort of charm without modern amenities. The rooms are dark and stuffy, the comforters are course, and they offer such things as hand drawn baths for 50 dollars. Seriously, I'd rather enjoy a fridge in the room...or maybe a coffee maker, but alas, those sort of amenities wouldn't fit the hotel's motif. The hotel staff are pretentious and rude and the food in the hotel restaurant is terrible. If you want to stay in a place with great hospitality, plush down comforters, fun atmosphere, kind and helpful hotel staff, then stay at the W in the French Quarter.

We were very happy to see the location. We were in town for Tulane Parent's weekend, so the location was central to campus, french quarter, and Magazine Street. Upon arrival, we were swiftly brought in to check in. We were taken to our room by Nabeel ,who was respectful (ladies first on the elevator), informative about the history of the hotel, and just plain friendly. For the next few days, he greeted us by name every time we walked through the lobby. We had limited time for a quick lunch and he quickly pointed us to a local spot called PG just a block away. It was a great reasonable eatery with local specials..crab cakes, jambalaya, shrimp creole. My husband went for breakfast as well . Nabeel should be commended for his representation of this hotel. It is evident that he loves this jewel in the city. Every staff member we encountered during our stay were polite and friendly. One of my favorite things about New Orleans in general is how hard they ty to make you feel welcome. True southern hospitality!The room was small, but adequate. The bathroom small as well. It was very clean and stocked with nice toiletries. When in New Orleans, I don't expect to spend a lot of time in the room, so no complaints. I found the room to be quite sound proof. Hot chocolate (delicious) and peanut butter sandwiches served each evening in the lobby were yummy. Le Pavillon tradition.Although parking was expensive, 28.00 plus about 3.00 tax, Le Pavillon is one of the few upscale hotels that offers free in room wireless internet. I have paid fifteen or more per laptop at other New Orleans Hotels, as well exorbitant parking fees..I would definately stay at this hotel again.A few suggestions for management.....I would love a coffee maker in the room. or complimentary coffee in the lobbyMany of the other upscale hotels offer cold beverages in the lobby late afternoon (lemonade or fruit flavored water), especially refeshing for dehydrated guests.Overall, a great stay!

From the time I entered the door, to the time I left, I saw lots of smiles and attention to guests of the hotel, including myself.I travel quite a bit and it is always nice to stay at a hotel where you feel appreciated.Great breakfast buffet, as well!

However, our experience was anything by thrilling. Our room at the Le Pavillon Hotel left much to be desired. The bed was not comfortable at all and the pillows very cheap feeling. The walls were very thin, so we heard our neighbors, who were pretty rowdy, all night long. The sensors in the mini fridge are obviously very messed up because as we were checking out, we heard two other guests making the same complaint as us in that they we billed in error for removing drinks. Overall, Le Pavillion did not even begin to measure up to the Sheraton in New Orleans, which we also frequently book for about $30.00 a night less via Hotwire. We will not return there again. .

The hotel is beautiful. It definitely evokes the old world French feeling that one is looking for when staying in New Orleans. Housekeeping was wonderful. Food was a bit pricey when eating at the hotel restaurants and would be described as usual hotel fare.Check in and out were great. We received the local paper daily and USA Today while staying.We had a few small glitches with the plumbing in the bathroom...the water wouldn't turn off every time...we did not report this tho as we usually were able to turn it off. The beds, although beautiful were really not that comfortable...it would behoove the hotel to bump it up on the linens (sheets, pillowcases) and perhaps check out the mattresses.Also, usually in 5* hotels, the management will contact the guest to inquire regarding the room status and to insure all is well after check in. It's a small but important detail.The bartender (I think her name is Gretchen) was very friendly. There was a piano player in the bar on Friday night and he was very good and friendly.The staff were courteous, helpful and pleasant. I was disappointed at times with little things...empty water bottles laying on the ground by the jacuzzi, milk carton left on the outside steps overnight by some guest after the pb j treat which is offered by the hotel gratis. The PB  J treat in the evenings was great. The hot chocolate was excellent.We had originally rented a car and the cost to park at the hotel overnight is 28.00 per night, which is exorbitant and should be reconsidered for hotel guests.When we were leaving, we requested a cab. The bell hop whistled and the cabbie pulled up. His van was disgustingly dirty. The hotel should check this out. Although it wasn't a part of our stay, it was the finish and although it is a cab, the hotel should only solicit those cabbies who provide good, clean service (cabbies generally sit right outside of the hotel)Overall, I would stay here again. We had a wonderful time. The hotel needs to only focus on these few small details in order to be a true 5*. ","SentimentRate" : 0.228, "Sentiment" : "Positive"}])
