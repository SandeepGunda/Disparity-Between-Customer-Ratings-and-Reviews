There were just a couple minor irritations. The biggest problem was the lack of a proper bathroom door. The door was akin to a door-sized window shutter that slid shut. It was just a bit uncomfortable to have little to no privacy while using bathroom. The room was quite small, which made the lack of a proper bathroom door much more irritating. Our room had a built in desk, mirror, closet and TV stand on one wall and the rest of the room was completely taken up by the queen-sized bed, with very little room to move around. If while traveling, you prefer a spacious room, this may not be for you, though they did manage to squeeze a very large flat screen TV in the room. That aside, everything else was great. The restaurant was top-notch and the outdoor seating area gave you the feeling that you were eating on the beach, which was nice. The lobby was also very well decorated. Also, the view from our room was great as we had a great view of the ocean and the park next door. The staff were very polite, but we really didn't interact with them too much so can't really give an opinion on them either way. As for the location, it is on the beach and is approx. half of one mile away from the area where most shops and hotels are located. The tours that we attended while in Hawaii didn't pick up from our hotel (not to say that others wouldn't) but asked that we walk down to the main street to meet at a larger hotel, which wasn't necessarily bad since we had nice weather, but depending on the weather, it could be a major inconvenience if you鈥檙e being picked up by tour companies. I would say that this was an average to above-average accommodation and is a good value for what you receive. ","SentimentRate" : 0.218, "Sentiment" : "mixed"}])

There is a sushi restaurant at the hotel which we have never tried. There are some amazing ( and not touristy ) restaurants a short cab ride away on Kapahulu Ave. that offer a variety of reasonable ethnic cuisine.The rooms can be a bit small but suggest ocean view only since the other rooms face high rises and this defeats the purpose of being in a tropical setting.

Everything was great at the hotel and the room was perfect,sea view and looking towards Waikiki beach. The beach outside of the hotel was great and the little coffee shop as you come out of the hotel did the best coffee and fresh sandwiches. We met some wonderfull people and the staff were very helpful .

It was a little ways from where we were staying, but it is in a very quiet end of Waikiki essentially in a park, on the beach. I went in and inquired about rates and I was very surprised that they were not much more than the place we were in three blocks from the beach.I walked back to my hotel, got my wife and walked back to have breakfast at the New Otani. She loved the place instantly, so while she was having breakfast I went to the men's room. I really went to the front desk and asked if they had any rooms open for the next four days. They did, I actually had a couple of choices and I chose an Ocean View Deluxe room for little more than I was was paying to not really see the ocean.I didn't tell my wife anything until after we got back to the other hotel after lunch. I started packing my bags. When she asked what I was doing, I told I had had it with where we were! She thought I was nuts.... well I can't carry off jokes very well so I told her I had booked at the New Otani. Her bag flew out of the closet as SHE packed to get over to the New Otani.Our room wasn't ready so the bellman held onto our bags, but we were able to change into our bathing suits and go enjoy the beach outside the side door of the hotel.What a delightthis hotel is! The dining room is literally on the beach!Our room was spacious enough, but not huge. But oh the view off our lani!! It looks down all of Waikiki Beach. We enjoyed watching the sunset from our room one night over a nice bottle of champagne.The one negative is I suppose that there is no pool, but since you are on top of a pristine beach with 80 degree water, that didn't really matter.I can't say enough good things about our experience here.
