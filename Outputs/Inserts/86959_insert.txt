There is no room to walk for 2 people without bumping into each other. Especially would not recommend renting the private unit 317 because the hotel does not have anything to do with the rental and the room is not cleaned on a daily basis and the room is not even maintained well. FYI- The furniture is old and the shower curtain was smelly too but was changed for us. There is rust in the room by the lock box and overall it鈥檚 not a good place to be when you are on vacation. Please save your money. I booked the room for 10 days but left the room in 4 days and didn鈥檛 even care if I got the rest of the money back or not (the room was so bad). I also killed a roach in the room.Aloha Surf Hotel Unit #317 ","SentimentRate" : -0.282, "Sentiment" : "Negative"}])

The rooms on the 3rd floor are fairly small and do not have balconies or views. The room was very clean however, and everything was in working order. The free wired internet was fantastic and much better than the wi-fi you normally find in hotels. The free safe, refrig, microwave, coffee maker, coffee, newspaper, LCD TV,etc. made up for the room. Although the hotel was renovated a few years ago somehow they managed to retain the shabby appearance. The room furnishings were disproportionately large for the size of the room and featured lots of drawers and shelves but not a desk nor writing area and not even a chair! Yes, they have a bowl of apples at the front desk and give you bottles of cold water upon check-in. Most of the staff was extremely nice although the person who checked me in (Ms. Sina) was efficient and professional but lacked the aloha spiriti. All in all, this is a good choice if you're looking for a budget hotel. ","SentimentRate" : 0.322, "Sentiment" : "Positive"}])

My girlfriend and I had our girlfriend getaway week at the Aqua Aloha Surf and Spa and it was great! Upon check-in the apples and the water are a welcome treat, the bar always had football on for me to check the scores of my Chicago Bears (Go Bears!), the free continental breakfast was swell, the free newspaper was a welcome treat to read at the beach daily, the room was small but cozy and very clean, the beds were comfy, the staff was friendly and helpful, and the beach and shopping and dining is all a quick walk away. Now, for fine print: if you want to pay $20 a day to park here, go ahead, but if you drive around the block slowly a few times you can find FREE parking along the sides of the road. All along Ala Wai street which is the street that backs up to the hotel has free parking everyday all day long if you can find a spot. Just drive slow and stalk people who look like they are walking to their cars! We never paid for parking all 5 days we were there! Then once there, walk next door to the food pantry and buy some lunch stuff that you can make your lunch each day, and that way you get breakfast for free, pack a picnic lunch for the beach, and dinner will be the only meal you have to pay for! You can do Hawaii on a budget you just have to be smart about it. Speaking of eating: YOU HAVE TO EAT AT THE YARDHOUSE FOR DINNER ONE NIGHT! IT'S SOME OF THE BEST FOOD I'VE EVER EATEN. Most important: if you are only planning on staying in honolulu and waikiki you are missing the real Hawaii. Take a trip less than an hour away up to North Shore and experience paradise at Waimea Bay - it's awe-inspiring. Enjoy all that Hawaii has to offer and breathe in the smell of fresh plumerias!

We needed an inexpensive place to stay several days before all the guests showed up for the Wedding hotel. I read about all the Aqua Boutique Hotels on-line and read the various reviews. When I found an incredible deal for the Aloha Surf, centrally located near the beach, that included free high speed Internet and continental breakfast, I couldn't pass it up. When my daughter heard about the deal, she had me book her a room too. That really put pressure on me since she lives in Japan. So, when we arrived at the Aloha Surf we were totally shocked that it was not rated as a 5-Star Hotel.It was super, super clean. The lobby was understated and beautiful. The staff could not do enough for us. They made you feel that you were a guest in their home and not a wallet to extract every cent. The room had everything that was advertised including a private lanai.I would have liked a desk in the room which would have made it more convenient for me to work. I needed an Ethernet cable to connect. The front desk simply handed it to me and asked if there was anything else I needed. The continental breakfast was better than most and was a great way to start the day without a hassle or an expense. Parking in their lot was convenient and less expensive than other hotels. My daughter was very pleased with everything at the Aloha Surf. Our biggest regret was that we had to leave the Aloha Surf and move to the clip joint down the block that was the wedding hotel. Anyone who is looking for more bang for their buck- and in these times who isn't- should definitely stay at the Aloha Surf  Spa Boutique Hotel. You will have the experience of Old Hawaiian hospitality in a technically up-to-date setting. Mahalo Aloha Surf! ","SentimentRate" : 0.303, "Sentiment" : "Positive"}])

Only takes a couple minutes to walk to the beach and then all along the Waikiki strip for food and shopping. This is the perfect place for the person wanting a nice clean place to stay when you are not planning on spending much time in the room. Which I think is most people going to Oahu. The rooms are nice and clean, but a little small. The parking was a little steep at $20/day and not being on the beach, but what do you do. Overall, I would say stay here if you are on a budget and an up-scale hotel is not the most important part of your vacation. ","SentimentRate" : 0.046, "Sentiment" : "Mixed"}])

The room was a little on the noisy side due to the louvered windows especially in the morning when the the garbage trucks are around.The staff people were very helpful except perhaps for the man at the breakfast area who told me that I couldn't use a large plate that I brought from the room to bring a couple slices of toast and some fruit back to the room. I guess there are people who come in and walk out with half the loaf of bread!! Really, there wasn't that much for me to want to walk out with.

One had show the room key to eat. No WiFi, instead it's cables they give you at check in. Over all, I would stay again the price of $256 for three night.
