The room was very clean and the beds were great. It only was a shame breakfast started to late for us, because we had to catch an early flight. If I ever come back, I'll for sure stay at this hotel again!"}])

New carpeting, lights, lobby, triple sheeting on the beds - all very clean and welcoming.Front deks was polite and very nice upon my late arrival from the airport. Free breakfast was included in the rate and I loved the waffles!I would stay here again! Glad they made the changes"}])

"Reviews" : "Wonderful staff and service Best Western Plaza is a great airport hotel. Their shuttle from the airport was quick and friendly. We were early but shown to a sparkling clean room even though they had been booked solid with a cancelled flight. Free internet service was a plus.We had a day left to tour but check-out was at noon. Our bags were stored in a locked room and even though we had checked out the shuttle brought us back to the airport at 5 PM. This is not a hotel that you would want to spend much time in since the location is industrial with some scary characters around. Between flights and overnight is great!"}])

"Reviews" : "fine for an airport hotel Just what we were looking for after 24 hours travelling. Efficient pick up and ckeck in. No problems such as those mentioned by others. Tried the Ohana but it was full. Had room in main tower. I always tavel with earplugs so if somewhere is a little noisy I have a solution, but I don't recall problems. It is an airport hotel so people will be arriving and leaving at all times. Breakfast starts a little late for this sort of place and restuarrant was closed when we arrived but we bought a sandwich at the shop (there is a take away next door). Though extortinately priced for a sandwich if was just the kind of convenience we were looking ."}])

The property is located near the airport, that is the only plus about it. The rooms were terrible. We were given 2 rooms as there were 4 of us. Both of the rooms were in outlying buildings, not the tower. They were both very dirty, I was walking in my socks and they turned black. The room was seedy looking as well. I slept on top of the bedspread, I was afraid to sleep in the bed, the sheets weren't very clean. Aside from that, just stay away..."}])

"Reviews" : "blood on pillow case and no action from management This was an overnight stay prior to flying to Maui. Upon checking in my wife pulled back the comforter and a 2 inch circle of blood was on the pillow case. I took the pillow to the desk and the staff were very concerned and advised the manager would be notified by them in the morning. Long story short the management has totally ignored my complaint and Best Western head office advise they can do nothing except keep my concerns on file for when they reviewed the hotel. Staff were friendly, management terrible"}])

"Reviews" : "Horrible! We were in Honolulu for 6 days and decided to stay here the last night because our flight left early. It is close to the airport and they have a free shuttle. Check-in was fine. We got to our room and could definitely smell cigarette smoke. It's a Non-smoking hotel...The bedspread had several cigarette burns in it, too. The room was very, very worn and shabby. The bathroom had hair in the tub and sink. I called the front desk and told them and asked to have another room. She said I would need to come down and she would see what she could do. She did get me another room , but the only one was a deluxe room. She didn't charge me for the upgrade. She was very sorry for the problems with the room and would contact security about the smoking.The new room didn't smell like smoke, but did smell. It was a very large, corner room, hence deluxe. The bed was very hard and we could feel the springs. The sheets had holes in them. The room was cleaner, though, so we stayed there. We could not get our money back. Right on the motor way so very noisy.The restaurant was closed, but they would shuttle us to their sister hotel down the street, The Ohana. We decided to drive to a nearby mall and eat at the Ruby Tuesday.One of the reasons we chose this hotel was because the car rental return was within walking distance and it needed to be back early the next morning. We returned it after dinner, though, and that was a wise move.We decided that we should have stayed in a hotel farther away and just left really early! Won't be staying here ever again!"}])

Rooms are spaicious enough and very clean, however the bed was very uncomfortableas well as pillows (very, very hard)!!!! The hotel is located right next to the motorway, thus it was extremely noisy - couldn't sleep at all! One good thing about this hotel, it is not far away from the airport."}])

It finally dissipated but not before giving me a terrible headache. The staff was excellent and very friendly. The hotel just needs major updates. For the price, we should get more."}])

"Reviews" : "Noise + Dirt = No Sleep I needed a quick overnight stay between flights to get some rest but this hotel was far from restful. It's location right under the on-ramp to H-1 Freeway made for heavy traffic noise which could slightly be drowned out by the even louder air conditioner.The entire room was filthy - I didn't even feel clean after taking a shower. There was hair on the toilet. There was hair in the bed (on the sheets) and there were ants by the sink. They picked me up and took back to the airport in a timely manner but that's about the only positive thing that came of this experience."}])

Staff as unfriendly as you can get ( change vocation if dealin with people is not your cup of tea ) How Best Western allows their name to be attached to this dump is beyond me.The only good thing was the burger joint close by and that had nothing to do wit th Hotel itself. The shuttle was nice and convenient.If ever the word Dive best describe a Hotel, this is it."}])

"Reviews" : "Horrible Hotel We stayed here overnight before our flight back home the next day. What drew our attention to the hotel was the location- so close to the airport. We, however, had to ring for a shuttle bus from the airport to take us there instead of walking. It is located on the highway, with very little restaurants, convenient stores- even fast food- close to it. I felt unsafe in this location. The room was smelly, and needed a refurbishment. Wallpaper coming off walls, mould in the fridge, and cardboard beds. The TV selection was exemplary though. The bathroom was to be expected of a hotel of this caliber. The hallways are dark and dingy, and the lobby too small. The free internet connection was enjoyable though.I do not recommend eating at the restaurant. The Seafood Buffet made us feel ill with badly prepared, very basic food. For $25 each, we were allowed the pleasure of sick stomachs during the night. Stay here with the sole purpose of sleeping for a quick night before a flight. Nothing else."}])

"Reviews" : "DIrty, Smelly, Noisy, Don't Stay Here! Our flight through US Airways was cancelled due to engine problems, so they graciously put us up in this hotel, due to it's location right next to the airport. It was four in the morning when we got there, and even though we were incredibly exhausted, my husband and I could not sleep. The room we stayed in was directly next to a highway where three roads converged and the traffic was so loud that it was impossible to sleep. Now I will admit that I am a light sleeper, but my home is located next to a highway and in the flight path of the Columbus Airport, so I hear planes fly overhead day and night. That was nothing compared to the noise of the traffic. I could not hear the television turned up on the highest volume. As for the cleanliness of the room, stay here if you want to see cockroaches in the shower. We found a few in the bathroom, along with mites all over the room. The next night when our flight was cancelled yet again (gotta love US Airways), we demanded to be put up in a nicer hotel. We got to stay at the Marriott down on Waikiki, which I would recommend in a heartbeat. Consider this a warning: due not stay at The Best Western Plaza hotel. Oh, and another warning. Watch out for US Airways. We arrived home three days late."}])

"Reviews" : "Do not stay here I recently traveled to Honolulu on a last minute business trip and needed to book a decently priced hotel quickly. I decided on the Best Western since I'm familiar with the chain and it was so close to the airport. Big mistake. My first issue was the location. It is located in a questionable area. Being a young woman traveling alone, safety is a major concern of mine. I felt like I was going to get robbed at any moment just walking from the curb to the front door.My second issue was with the room itself. Once I got there, I couldn't believe that I had paid $125. It wasn't worth half that. I stopped counting at the third hair I found in the bathroom. There were popcorn kernels on the nightstand. The lamp by the nightstand was burnt out. There were strange burn marks all over the carpet. The mini-fridge, although a nice ammenity in concept, was so grimy and moldy on the inside that I definitely wouldn't have used it. Weary from the trip from Columbus, Ohio, I stayed there that night against my better judgement. I promptly checked out the next morning. I spent the remainder of my trip at a hotel on Waikiki Beach for just $7 more per night. Very safe, clean and in a great location. Highly worth it."}])

"Reviews" : "Very close to airport We booked this hotel and then read the reviews, I was very worried but too late to do anything. My fears were unfounded.As we were arriving at 5pm and leaving the next day at 10am it was great to be so close to the airport. The shuttle was quick to pick us up and all the staff friendly.The noise from the freeway was noticable but not overbearing, was fairly quiet during sleeping time. The decor was a bit dated and the wallpaper peeling in places but the room was clean and all the fixtures were well maintained. The bathroom may have been renovated since other reviews as ours was very clean, no mould or dodgy fixtures.We had a complimentary hot breakfast and that was ok. Not a big choice but nicely cooked and enough to satisfy you. The diner next door (Byron's) is fantastic value and there were some other shops (Jamba Juice, coffee shop, chinese and small grocery store) another block away.Whilst it wasn't ultra modern and does need updating it was clean and comfortable. I would happily stay their again as an overnight stopover. It definitely wasn't a suitable location as a holiday place."}])
