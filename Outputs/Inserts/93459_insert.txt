"Reviews" : "A nice hotel in New Orleans The New Orleans tourism site offered 'Papa Noel' rates for many hotels over Christmas. We selected the Hampton Inn hotel as it was closest to our family and out of the crowded touristy French Quarter.It was a great choice! Lovely lobby area. An outdoor lap pool (too cold to use in Dec.) and open cocktail type area to congregate for breakfast or anytime. Free breakfast daily, and it was a full meal, not just bagels and coffee, and the menu changed daily. Great afternoon tea as well. Room was very new looking, and nice and clean. Hotel staff was very helpful and friendly. We appreciated the full time night watchman in the lobby at night, too, which made us feel very safe. The St Charles trolley car was just outside our door.The hotel is located halfway between touristy French Quarter and Tulane/Audobon Zoo area. We enjoyed our visit to New Orleans very much and the Hampton Inn made it a very comfortable and pleasant stay. "}])

"Reviews" : "A good hotel in a good location I travel to New Orleans on business once a month or so. I like the personal feel of this hotel. The staff is very friendly and the lobby is a nice size...you don't feel overwhelmed. The lobby has a computer for surfing the web or you can do WiFi in your room which I connected to with no problems. The breakfast is decent and the afternoon cheese and crackers make a great pre dinner snack. My room is always clean. Great bed and pillows, Quiet, Fridge, microwave. My only complaint is the secure card swipe slot in the elevator is touchy.I won't comment on the price as I am not paying....but my rate was $131 per night. For food try the mexican place next door, Fat Harry's or Cannon's....all are good. Try the Bull Dog if you want an adventure or more local flavor.KS "}])

"Reviews" : "Convenient and comfortable I stayed at the Hampton Inn Garden District for a week with my 86 year old mother and 3 daughters while we were visiting my sister. The rooms were a nice size, with a refrigerator and microwave. The beds are very comfortable. The cheese, fruit and tea reception in the late afternoon is a nice way to relax after a day of siteseeing, and if you'd like a drink to go with your cheese the Superior Grill 2 doors away makes a mean margarita to go. Parking is free, and the hotel is conveniently located. You can also jump on the streetcar (which stops across the street from the hotel) to get to the French Quarter or to Riverbend, where there are some great restaurants. The hotel staff is very friendly and helpful, and we enjoyed our stay. "}])

"Reviews" : "Rather Impressed! Stayed at this hotel for the BCS Championship Game weekend and enjoyed it! Staff was friendly, and the price was not bad for a busy weekend. Bed was comfortable and room was decent size. Bathroom was clean and always had plenty of hot water. However, the pipes are a bit noisy so if you are a light sleeper ask for an end room. Was a great hotel for a busy weekend! "}])

"Reviews" : "Overpriced My daughter lives in New Orleans and I travel there frequently. This hotel is clean and in a quiet area. It is however, overpriced. You can find great hotels in the quarter for under $100 bucks. We paid $180.00 a night. The room had a very stale smell to it and only a shower no tub. "}])

"Reviews" : "Excellent Choice for Business Traveler, Tourists A very nice hotel. Good amenities (ice tea and snacks in the afternoon, free breakfast in the morning, coffemaker, microwave, fridge in room). If you are a jogger, this is an excellent location - run down St. Charles for a few miles in the former trolley tracks or drive a few blocks to Audubon Park and run the loop there. Close to nice restaurants and a large Whole Foods on Magazine Street. A great value too. I will definitely stay here again. "}])

"Reviews" : "A Great Choice! We've just returned from a delightful visit to New Orleans for my son's wedding. Staying at the Hampton Inn on St. Charles Avenue helped make it a pleasure from start to finish. The hotel itself is very attractive and clean with a charming outdoor pool and seating area. The staff were kind, helpful and very friendly. Our group, which included a child, enjoyed the many selections offered at breakfast and the afternoon tea. The parking area is free, safe, and just a few steps from the entrance. It was so convenient to many of this wonderful city's attractions, we very much hope to stay there again. "}])

"Reviews" : "Great Experience...Could not be better. I stayed there for a week. The room was large and clean; it had a refrigerator; lots of TV channels, and free wireless connection. The breakfast was pretty good, and the cheese and crackers with tea in the afternoon was nice. My 4 year old grandaughter loved the pool, which was kept very clean. One of the best features is a free parking lot right behind the main back entrance to the hotel. It is safe and easy to use. The staff is really friendly. It is also convenient to getting to almost all of New Orleans by car...every thing is about 15 minutes away. I would stay there again and again. I was in NOLA for pleasure visiting my daughter and her family, but I travel in my work as a lawyer and spend many nights each year in hotels around the world. And this is one terrific hotel in a great, great city. "}])

"Reviews" : "Highly recommend This hotel was simply wonderful. Designed to look old, but only about10 years old, the hotel was beautifully decorated and set a veryNew Orleans mood. The location is terrific. It does not have a Fitness Center or laundry, but we didn't care. Their breakfast servedthe best fruit we had at a Hampton, on a long trip. We had great service from two employees in particular: Manager Charlene Martinez was extremely helpful, and Rose, who was serving breakfast, was a joy! (Hi to you both!)New Orleans is still a great city, yet it's one in extreme pain. We were so glad to visit there, to spend our money in a place that desperately needs support from business and individuals. The French Quarter was great, as always. But we drove all around the surroundingareas, and the tragic effects of Katrina are evident everywhere. The devastation was so extensive it will take years to come back. Here's a place where we can really make a difference. "}])

"Reviews" : "perfect for us!!! I rely heavily on reviews within this forum..so I thought I would add mine on the Hampton Inn in the Garden District. It was perfect for us...my daughter and I were traveling to Tulane and I was looking for accomadations between downtown and the school. Service and Hotel: The staff was very friendly and went out of their way to be helpful. We arrived at about 10:30 for check in and they were not ready for us...but quickly found us a room. The room was clean enought...but the really great thing was how comfortable the bed was. It had 6 comfy useable pillows and a down comforter covered with a duvet...as most of us do not spend a lot of time in the room ..this great bed and hot shower were just perfect.It is about a 2 mile distance to Tulane which was perfect for a walk....Within the area is a Rite Aid to pick up incidentals , The Superior Grill which has great tex mex and huge magaritas, Columns is 2 blocks away with a great bar and really nice Sunday Brunch, Cannon's is just up the street...The Hampton Inn worked really well for mom and daughter wanting to see a little more than the french quarter...although we have done that too.

"Reviews" : "OK only for quietness and location Generally clean though housekeeping was not thorough. Breakfast mediocre at best. Front desk gives incorrect advice/travel directions. Good aspects were the quiet area and the free internet access in the lobby. The quiet area part is important because much of the city is still in bad shape, and only 1 streetcar (trolley) line is up, and that's the one that goes along St Charles (line 12.) There is limited public transportation; you will wait quite a while for a bus. The hotel is in the Garden District, which is 2+ miles from the French Quarter and has the look and feel of a suburb with is mansions (these as far as I know are not open for public visits.) The area is very good though for mid-priced hip restaurants (Magazine Street, about 5 or so bad blocks away) and mid-priced shopping (antiques and boutique clothing stores.) The area between St Charles and Magazine is not good at all. Note: The French Quarter businesses (what is left of them) charge too much for their products, and the downtown are is largely rundown and tacky. So the Garden District is a good base, maybe another hotel should be chosen though. "}])

"Reviews" : "Reliable, safe mid-$$$ option for Garden District I stayed here for a Tulane event (they generously paid for it, at $119 per night. That was probably a special/bulk rate so I don't know how that compares to rack rates.) It is a nice, consistent hotel, with great rooms and wonderful breakfast included, and free parking. The location would be great for Mardi Gras (right on the beginning of the parade route) or for anyone who wanted to stay in the Garden District/closer to Tulane than the Quarter. This place is definitely nicer than what you'll get for the same price downtown. The staff was very friendly and the entire stay was just pleasant; you got the feeling things were run very smoothly and efficiently. The room was very large and I would say this would be a good choice for those with children, or a car. There is a bus line currently running down St Charles Av to replace the streetcar (to which they are still repairing the damage from Katrina at least through this fall,) so you wouldn't NEED a car to get to the Quarter, but if you do have one, you'll get free, secure parking here which is hard to come by. I'm surprised it's only rated 2 stars. The only drawback, if any... it IS a chain hotel, so you won't get any quirky, historic New Orleans charm. on the flipside, I've stayed at plenty of hotels that DO offer that and I have found it to be more of a 'gamble.' Things were consistent and safe and pleasant here. Overall highly recommended, if it's in your price range. "}])

"Reviews" : "Accommodated Four Families with Eleven Children Graciously We were in New Orleans for a family reunion and wanted a place to stay not far from my Grandmother's house near Tulane. This hotel is on St. Charles Avenue, and suited our purposes well (to visit the French Quarter, or Tulane, however, you will need to drive or take a cab). Among our group we had rooms with King beds and a pullout sofa (feels more spacious during the day, but the pullout sofa is best for two small children or one larger person) as well as rooms with two doubles. The rooms were clean and the staff was friendly. Continental breakfast (with a daily hot choice, such as the fixings for a breakfast sandwich) is included. In the late afternoon cheese and fruit are served, and coffee is available 24 hours. There is a small pool (we called it a half pool because it was only 6 or 8 feet wide, like a lap pool for one swimmer). It worked for our young swimmers, however, as it ranged from 3 to 4 feet deep. (As of August 21st, the pool was closed for resurfacing). There is no air conditioning in the halls on the room floors (not a big problem - just strange). The air conditioning in the rooms worked well. We had a great stay and felt welcomed, even though we were accompanied by lots of children. There seemed to be a number of people staying semi long-term (working for a while, or coming down every weekend to work on their houses). "}])

"Reviews" : "Very nice This was the third time I've stayed at the hotel. It's a very convenient location for those with Tulane students plus there's ample free parking. I feel safe here when I travel by myself. They weren't busy so the rate for the whirlpool street view room was the same as the rate for the regular room. The room was huge for this type of hotel. King bed, walking space, console with tv on top, then spacious area with microwave/refrigerator, table with 4 chairs and sofa bed. The rooms have been upgraded. The new beds are great. Good pillows too. Bathroom was large enough for double sink and garden sized whirlpool tub. Room was clean but not spotless. Housekeeping needs to do a better job preventing the mold in the tub corners (a Tilex should have been used two days ago to prevent the mold as opposed to this is gross and needs a major bleach job). Breakfast is typical for this chain. Public areas are very nice. "}])
