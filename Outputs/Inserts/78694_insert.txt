The restaurant food was good and the staff very helpful.We loved not having to drive in LA (we only went to Universal Studios)."}])

"Reviews" : "didn't want to leave I stayed at the Hilton the weekend before Christmas, because I was attending a concert at Universal City Walk. I was torn between the Hilton and the Sheraton, but I relied on the reviews from this website and was satisfied with my choice. The Staff was friendly. The Hotel was beautiful. The room was large and clean. It was a really nice room. The view was also lovely. I only booked the room for one nite, but when it was time to checkout I was not ready to go. There wasn't a lot of noise, like at other hotels. It you are going to Universal Studios or Universal City Walk, it is the closest hotel. You can actually walk to Universal City Walk or take the shuttle. I am very cheap, but I think I got a good deal. I regret that once again I forgot my camera, and didn't take pictures. The environment was just really relaxing."}])

"Reviews" : "Great hotel for Universal Studios visit This hotel is excellently located for a visit to Univeral Studios as it is right next door. It also has Citywalk area there fo ra variety of restaurants and free shuttle service which makes this U Studios experience v easy as we only had two nights in LA. Its location is also central enough to visit other sites in LA such as the Sidewalk of Stars (not sure what correct name is). The hotel rooms are surprisingly large and the elevated views is a nice extra. It has the excellent amenities of Hiltons with teh assoicated v attractive deals which come with being a Hilton member. Definately worth checking out if going to that part of LA."}])

"Reviews" : "Loved the location We stayed at this hotel last October for 5 nights. The overall experience was great. We had a room on the 21st floor and the view was awesome. We booked this hotel from the hilton website as we found better rates. The location is also great. There is a shuttle bus that runs every 10 minutes to Universal City Walk which we found good.The room was always clean and the furniture is nice. Out of 5 hotels we stayed in during our holiday, this is probably the best one."}])

"Reviews" : "Beware the Bedbugs I stayed at the Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City the week of November 17, 2008 for a business trip. My initial impression of the hotel was favorable, as the staff were very courteous, the room was spacious and I received a complimentary fruit basket on my first night there. However, upon waking up the first morning, I found bed bugs in my bed. This was a horrifying and unwelcome surprise at 5:30 AM. I immediately called the front desk and was put on hold for 10 minutes, after which I explained the situation to the night supervisor and requested to be given another room immediately. During this conversation with the night supervisor, at no time did she apologize, although she did agree to provide another room by 6:30 AM. Upon moving to my new room, I inspected the bed carefully and found that while the sheets appeared to be clean, under the mattress, on the dust ruffle and around the headboard there was a great deal of dirt, dust and human hair. It was obvious the full bedding had not been changed or cleaned in some time. I did try to reach the hotel manager, and he did try to contact me during my stay, but we missed each other as I was in meetings most of the time there. I will follow up with a letter to him about the situation and give him a chance to respond, but as of right now, no discount was given to me on my bill and the only apology I received was from the front desk clerk when I went down to exchange room keys. My recommendation is that if you stay at this hotel, you should carefully check the bedding before going to sleep."}])

"Reviews" : "Dont stay here- We had a terrible experience We had 5 rooms, the keys were just given out and our parents did not get the large room the requested, instead it was given to one of our guests and they didnt want to be rude so they kept the smaller room. The air was not on in the room and our thermostat read 90 degrees, it took hours for it to cool down. My bf sat on the bed and the bead was broken, the box spring was split in half. we called the front desk and they said they could put us on another floor which we did not want to do b/c we were already unpacked and had booked our rooms next to one another. They said they would send someone up to exchange it, never happend. So we just slept on it. One of guests went to get into the bed and a nasty bottle of lotion was in the sheets- obviosly the sheets were not changed. she requested her sheets to be changed and someone came up and gave her the sheets but he said I dont do sheets she had to change them herself. This is all on day 1- next day we woke up for early morning plans and there was no hot water- no one was able to shower until that evening. Just a bad experience with no compassion for our inconvienances from the hotel or staff. We might as well stayed in a hotel 6. Thats what i would compare this hotel to"}])

"Reviews" : "Ordinary hilton I stayed here cause everyone was raving about it on trip advisor. Seriously, there is nothing special about this place, except that it is a short stroll from Universal Studios.The place is quite dated, the type of hotel lobby that was nice in the 80s, but needs an upgrade.It's OK- well equipt, but seriously nothing special. Stay only if necessary, otherwise, keep looking!PS really bad location if you are wanting to see other sights in LA. So far from everything."}])

"Reviews" : "Fantastic hotel - couldn't have asked for more!!! My husband and I and our 3 children just recently stayed at the Hilton in Universal City whilst we were visiting the US. The hotel was fantastic!!! Best location for visiting Universal studios and for seeing the sights of LA (we did have a car though). Universal studios was across the road so we had no worries about trying to get through the LA traffic to get there on time. Universal City was next door and that was fantastic for dinners, lots of child friendly restaurants and shops and we felt very safe strolling through the area at night. There was a free shuttle back to the hotel if we wanted to use it rather than walking, we did take advantage of that on a few nights after we had been walking all day!! The room itself was great - large, clean and great views! We were worried as we had two rooms and wanted interconnecting but that was no problem which was a great relief. We stayed on the executive level which included a free continental breakfast each day which was fantastic! Nice and healthy - fresh fruit, cereal, coffee, toast, yoghurt etc..Great start to the day.I was really happy that we stayed at this hotel it was the first hotel we stayed at on our holiday and we returned to it on our last night before leaving the US. Would highly recommend it to anyone!!!!"}])

"Reviews" : "No Refund Given!!!!!!!!!!!!! Beware! Don't book with HILTON !!!I booked this hotel because I needed to run the LA Marathon.The LA Marathon moved the date two weeks earlier.I called and emailed Hilton to see if I could change my reservaton. Multiple calls and emails later, they still said No, sorry, can't modify or cancel your reservation even though it was a month ahead of time!Beware! If you are staying in this caliber of hotel anyway, book with another chain, and avoid the Hilton chain and its affiliate hotels. In the past I have had great cusomer service with Hyatt Regency. In fact this is the worst service I have ever encountered even with less expensive hotels."}])

"Reviews" : "Couldn't have been more accomodating Decided to attend my High School reunion being held at the Sheraton, but liked the Hilton better, so decided to stay there for that night. I needed a double-bed room, as I needed to bring my disabled mother (whom I care for) and we need to have our own beds.The hotel was very busy that Saturday, and when we checked in, the desk clerk said they only had a room with a king bed...NO WAY! I had reserved a double bed room!, I explained, as I pointed to my mother waiting at the side in her wheelchair.The desk clerk got my drift, and was very understanding. She began punching in buttons on her computer and making calls, and wha-lah, a recently vacated room popped up. Yeah!The only complaint is that the air conditioning did not seem to work...could not adjust cooler or more fan circulation. The bellhop said he could try to get us a fan (accomodating and extremely nice man), but apparently, none was to be found.I ordered room service for Mom and then talked with the desk. They said that if I left them my cell number, they would call me if Mom needed me, and that they would alert security that there was a disabled person in our room (in case of emergency). So nice! After I left to attend the reunion, Mom's dinner was delivered (that person was helpful with getting her to the table and helping with her food preparation), and they later did a physical check-in with her, with a complimentary fruit basket in hand, just to be sure she was O.K. That was above and beyond the call of duty!!! I was so gratefull for their attentiveness to our needs, and that because of that, I was allowed to have a carefree night out (which is seldom, when you are a full-time caregiver!). Everyone, including the bellman who kept Mom company while I retreived our car upon leaving, was exceptionally kind, friendly, professional and accomodating!Thank you, Hilton Hotel!!!KB EdwardsPorter Ranch, CA"}])
